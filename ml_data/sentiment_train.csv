0,"Very nice family, adorable baby and little daughter. Host was readily available for suggestions or a quick chat. I just wish there was a fan in the room. It was really hot, and unfortunately we could not escape the summer heat so we left a day earlier than planned. "
-1,"It was a nice Weekend in Amsterdam . The Appartement and Most of all, the Place on the roof was beautiful. Amazing Allround view over amsterdam. The stairs up Till the 5 floor is a Long Way and Maybe You Should be sporty. ;) 
But i was Really disappointed about the cleaniless. It was Really Dirty as we arrived the appartment. Worst Problem was, thats throughout the apartment everywhere was many many cats hair. Iam an animal hair allergy... And if i had know That there lives animals, Most of all cats, i had Not booked this Appartement .
The appartment is Really Really close to all the Important Spots of amsterdam, but for this Price it have to be clean when the guest arrived. I Really wish i Could Stay there in the Future again, but with my Allergy it isnt possible. But Really nice Host and a friendly welcome .

1,Jacqueline is an awfully nice host.She will let you know everything there is to know about the area or Amsterdam.She even picked me up from the station in Diemen because it was raining.The room is according to the pictures and quite simple. Not necessarily perfect for people allergiced to smoke but still a clean house. Thank you for a nice stay.
1,"Lovely very comfortable appartment! perfect to relax and Nick is a great host, really friendly, who gives you a warm welcome. The appartment has everything you need for a very comfortable stay, there is a bus stop in front of the appartment by bus it's less ten 10 minutes from the city centre and there are many busses going near the appartment, also there are a lot of shops just a couple of minutes walking would recommend to stay here! "
1,"The apartment was great! Very clean and cute. Judit gave us great directions from the train station and it was an easy find for me and my boyfriend! I wish it was a tad closer to central area of Amsterdam, it's about 15 or so minutes by bus. Had a great stay all-in-all!!"
-1,Its a scam
1,"Malin's place was great!  We needed a last-minute place to stay, and the quick communication and willingness to work with us was very much appreciated.  Clean apartment typical of Amsterdam.  Within the range of the tram light rail, so it's not too tough to get into the central district."
1,"Clean, private room with all the necessities. 7 minute walk to public transportation. "
-1,"This place was a nightmare. We arrived and the hosts weren’t even there. The check in was handled by a rental agency.

First, be prepared for a steep and long climb up some dangerous stairs. The banisters are not very well painted, so expect splinters as you hold on for dear life on the way down.

Next, there was human excrement, unflushed, waiting for us in the filthy toilet. Clearly the place had not been properly cleaned. They made the bed and that’s it. They charge a cleaning fee, but in the rules they state that the renter should clean the place or incur additional charges. What a scam!

Anyway, there was hair in the shower all over the walls, and the door to the bathroom is covered in extremely offensive graffiti. Like dive bar level dicks and aggressive sexist comments. I was pretty horrified, and frankly very uncomfortable.

The shower tap for the cold water was completely broken from day one, and I ended up not showering the last 2 days because it became impossible to turn on at all. Also, we had to put the shower head on the ground because we couldn’t turn the water off and it was constantly dripping. We mentioned all this to the rental company, and they did nothing.

Next is the bedroom. It’s basically a closet, and the bed is up extremely high. There is a small step ladder provided, but even I, at 1.67cm struggled to get up and down comfortably. It was really unsafe. Also, there’s a tiny fan in there, but it still feels stuffy.

In the main living area, the counters and tables looked like they had not been properly cleaned in a while, and there were no curtains. Supposedly this place accommodates up to 4 people, but whoever sleeps on the pull out couch better expect to rise with the sun. 

We had made our reservation for 3 people, and when we arrived only the bed was made and there were only 2 towels. We had to wait until the next day to get linens for the third person. Which given the state of cleanliness was a bit scary just sleeping on the couch.

The only good thing we can say about this place is that the area is really beautiful, and the neighbors were super nice. Other than that, AVOID THIS PLACE UNTIL ITS UNDER BETTER MANAGEMENT!!"
0,"Me and my friends had a lovely stay in Amsterdam and enjoyed many features of this apartment however I feel that the pictures do need updating as they do not show how it currently looks.
We never met Alisa, when we arrived to the apartment we tried to call her after 10 minutes of waiting for her to arrive as we got there on time and as the keys weren't in the master lock (although stated on the itinerary a set of keys would be left there, to let ourselves in should she be late) all we could do was wait. Peter, who lives on the 1t floor came down, let us in and showed us around. We were confused as we were never told that she wouldn't be coming and even on the itinerary it said that two of her other friends would check us in should she be busy with work and that we would be told before hand.
We were told that if we had any problems to call Alisa or knock on his door. This was a problem when we had a power cut, we tried to ring Alisa again and knocked on Peters door, both attempts to fix a problem were unsuccessful, so communication was awful. 
The apartment was not very clean at all, at first it was quite stressful for some of us but we just got on with it and made the most of our trip. It felt as though a family were living in the apartment just before we rented it as the rooms had a lot of clutter and toys laying around. The thing that let it down the most were the bathrooms and the kitchen. 
Location wise, it is great! We didn't use public transport apart from getting to and from the airport. Living with the market below us in the street was amazing, and you can easily walk to main attractions and squares from there. 
The roof terrace (although not clean) was a really nice feature to this apartment and we enjoyed evening drinks and just general relaxing up there.
Overall it is a great location really nice to have everything so accessible! Let downs, it wasn't exactly like the pictures, we couldn't get hold of anyone and it was not clean."
1,"Liz is a spectacularly good host. She gave us plenty of space but always magically appeared when we had a question. The deck at the back of the houseboat is a lovely oasis from the bustle of Amsterdam. The location is fantastic too. You can walk everywhere but it's super quiet.
Highly recommended"
1,"Great studio, it was a real pleasure to stay at Anouk's place. They are really hospitable, helpful and communicative  with any question you might have.  The place it-self is clean, with a great location, about 15-20 minutes commute to the downtown.
Totally recommend and suggest staying at Anouk's place."
-1,"Communication before reaching the flat was great, and we were allowed to check in late, self check in was available with a key pad. but once we were in the flat it was very uncomfortable we had to guessed which of the rooms was ours and where the toilet was. and although we saw people in the house several times it felt as if they have been hiding or a avoiding to greet. The house was not clean the floor in our room had stains everywhere. And was wet, the bed lining smell very bad, the pillows are so old and very bad quality, I wouldn’t called these pillow. no hand towels only small towel to shower, no hand soap, poor hygiene in the toilet. 
This is the first time I have such a bad experience with Airbnb, I did not enjoyed staying in this place."
-1,Dirty and disgusting apartment... awful neighbourhood...you have no sockets in the bathroom...the Garden was full of weeds but not the good (URL HIDDEN) batteries for the remotes of the middleaged TV... 30 Minutes to central minimum...very disappointing!
1,"Lettie’s place is a quiet oasis in a busy city! The apartment is lovely with a full kitchen & lots of space.  Lettie is a gracious host, willing to help travelers navigate around town with lots of helpful suggestions.  I highly recommend staying here!"
0,"To sum up: house normal and communication awful.

The house was as normal as she described, nothing more and nothing less (that’s a good thing). The only thing wrong about it, it was the WIFI. We didn’t get to use it (even if it’s the greatest and the expensiver pack in the whole europe) because we didn’t get the user and the pass (normal thing to do in the check-in) so we got to search for it until we just gave up. (It’s in the description of the house but the communication as I said was very chaotic).

Related with communication, we booked the house around 6 months in advance, no messages came in that time. The problems came when she changed me the check-in time the very day that we arrived to the city and even when we came at the time that she told us, we had to wait 15 min until a woman that didn’t speak english showed us the rooms of the house and nothing more.

And at the end, i tried to ask for the check out in 3 or 4 messages too but no answer came. So in conclusion I didn’t get to know her and the communication by messages wasn’t very usefull at all."
1,Mirjam kindly welcomed me at the bus stop when I arrived because it was midnight and raining. She made herself very accessible and she provided nice breakfast. Her apartment is not very centrally located but it doesn't take very long by bus to the centraal station. The room is big and bed is comfortable. Very enjoyable experience!
-1,"Bad experience, not recommended "
1,"I stayed with my boyfriend for a week at Emil's place. Emil is a great guy, he was very welcoming and helpful.
We had a clean and cozy room and the apartment was a 5 min walk to the metro.
"
1,The neighborhood was really lovely and the commute to the center of the city was very easy. The apartment is a great place to stay and Carolina was a very helpful host!
1,"René has been very effective in the entire process, from booking till hosting. The flat is very nice in excellent position. I really recommend it if u want to stay close to city center in a very convenient location. The flat has all u need with high comfort
I will come back again if possible."
1,"The cabin is in a very pretty area outside of the city center. The cabin is a little dated and the appliances are certainly not anything fancy,  but they do work.  We didn't mind because it was a good deal compared to everything else we had found in the city.  The other main reason we were ok with the more rural area was because of the bikes. The bikes are free,  but they are pretty awful.  One of them had a chain that is too big,  so if you bumped it, it would fall off and you no longer had brakes... Overall we enjoyed coming home to a quiet natural area after our long days in the bustle of the city.  "
-1,"Just terrible. We would advise everyone not to enter this apartment.  Because the host has a camera in the apartment. 
In additional he is living next door, but he likes not to say that before you are arriving and with every sound he complain. 
Furthermore the apartment was not clean.
Moreover the facilities were bad we did not even had a rag to clean.

Furthermore the toilet and the bathroom are separated but you can see through the wall. 
In additional sometimes when he wanted he came in our apartment, once even when someone was at home sleeping. So for people who wants their privacy it's nothing.

Very special or just awful we found that the host ""repaired"" a broken window with a piece of carton."
-1,"Awful experience with Max. The day of check in I sent a note confirming details about checking in. His response was that he had “lost the keys” and tried to move me to another property which would not meet my needs. When I suggested a locksmith he did not respond. When I asked him to cancel the reservation he did not respond. Ultimately Airbnb support came in and canceled the reservation and is refunding me. 

The one bright side to this was that I could not find another place to stay in Amsterdam on such short notice so my girlfriend and I ended up renting a car and staying on a Dutch farm. The farm is way better than Amsterdam, but I suppose if I actually were dead set on staying in Amsterdam then Max would have completely ruined our vacation with his scam and/or incompetence. 
"
1,Great location and stylish space. Marinus was a wonderful host and was very flexible with our arrival. Highly recommend!
1,"it was a really pleasant staying.Quite close to the center of the city (it will take u 12 minutes by bus),while calm and nice district,appartment is very spacious,cosy and well equipped.We liked either flat or host.Strictly recommend!!!"
1,"The house is in a quiet area but not far from the central, easy access to the public transportation which means u can go to the sights without trouble.  Elsie recommended us beautiful routes for sightseeing. She prepared breakfast for us every day and u can asked her any question about Amsterdam, she will tell you a lot. "
0,"After some initial miscommunication (I was informed 2 days before arrival that there is a 20EUR fee for checking in after 8pm, which really should be displayed more prominently in the description), I had a good stay and Twan was responsive and friendly to deal with.  This apartment is great for a short weekend stay (roomy, fairly modern, nice big windows, central), but not as much for a business traveler (iron and board are unusable, shower is awful).  Keep in mind that this apt is very central, the street is noisy and busy all hours throughout the night.  Overall I thought it was just fine - there was some good and some bad - pretty average to slightly above-average experience overall."
1,"A very nice apartment, clean and a lovely look, very close to the museum quarter and very easy access to everything else.  We were disappointed that canal works were happening right outside the front door. They were excruciatingly noisy from sunrise to sunset, we couldn't have the windows open during beautifully hot weather and had paid the premium rate for the apartment, we were not made aware of this either, had we been told we would have gone elsewhere.  I feel this should have been brought to our attention beforehand.
The bed is lovely but ruined by budget sheets. The itchy, cheap bedding combined with the hot weather was just awful. We ended up getting on the couch most nights! 
The kitchen is equipped with most things you will need except cooking utensils, couldn't find a spatula or wooden spoon anywhere. Made cooking quite difficult, we thought about buying some but expected them to be available. I wouldn't quite say 5* luxury but a nice place.
"
1,"This is a very clean, spacious, and comfortable apartment. It is in a highly central location, close to the museums (10 mn. by walk), and public transportation. Only within a few blocks, one can find grocery stores, restaurants, and cafes. Despite its centrality, it is in a  quiet neighborhood. We encountered no problems during our stay. I highly recommend it."
1,Anna Sophie’s place is a dream. It’s located in a hip part of AMS and is away from everything (but only by a block) so you can enjoy quiet. There’s a fantastic roof deck too. A heads up it was a heat wave in Europe when we were there so it got a little warm during the day but otherwise fantastic stay and will return!
1,"The appartment was very nice and we had some wonderful days in Amsterdam. From Amterdam Centraal to the appartment ~20mins with tram 16. There are lots of restaurants and ""touristik sights"" in the area of the appartment.
So everything was very nice, next time again!"
-1,"Pros:
Excellent location. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, cafes, tram stop and points of interest
Great view of the canal with boats passing by all day long

Cons
Very bad experience with check in time. Instead of 1pm checkin as advertised, we were asked to wait till 3 as the apartment was not ready. We were there with a tired toddler, after a very long journey waiting downstairs and insisted on checking in as we had no other place to go with a baby and all the luggage.
Apartment was not cleaned, bed wasn't made so we had to wait 3 more hours for various folks to come in and get it ready.
The white couch and the pillows in the apt are extremely dirty - unusable almost.
There were no napkins in the bathroom. No hand soap in the bathroom.
Kitchen was clean but utensils etc inside the cabinets were not very clean.
No paper napkins in the apartment. Dirty kitchen towels.
While checking in, no one explained us anything about the apartment, amenities or things we should know.

Overall, great location and view but lacked in cleanliness and amenities."
1,"The flat is in a great location, you can reach by walking all places to visit. Lin has been a great landlady and the communication with her has been very fast. We were 13 people and the apartment was perfect for us.
Our stay in Amsterdam has been lovely!"
1,"Bob was super friendly and was even thoughtful enough to make sure we had all we needed, sent us texts with helpful and very informative facts about the area and was accessible whenever we needed. 
The place was sweet and cozy, does have angled ceilings so not recommended for tall people, does get loud in the early am and you can hear the hustle le and bustle from the streets below but to us it added to the charm. The balcony was charming, allowed us to enjoy and check the weather feel before heading out for the day. Location was prime! Coffee, fries and sandwiches right down stairs, short walk to the more busy area and museums. "
1,"Great location, and a wonderful experience to stay on a houseboat in Amsterdam. 
Host was very helpful with tourist tips and accommodating for everything we needed."
-1,"Dear all, bare with me as this review is extremely long, however covers everything and what you need to know if you're considering this apartment. Cleanliness was the biggest concern of ours. Upon arrival, the apartment smelt extremely funny, and all towels and sheets had to be washed as they smelt very odd and unclean. The kitchen had a mop in a bucket filled with dirty water simply left in the corner as if the apartment was being shared and as if we weren't guests. Added to that, there was washing left to hang on the balcony area (presumably from the last guests) that had not been cared for or sorted out by Bas (which was rather irritating having to do someone else's washing as a guest in this apartment). The worst part of the kitchen however, was the fridge. The fridge had an awful smell. It's very difficult to describe, however I'd say a mix of: sweaty feet, off food, rotten milk and just uncleanliness. With that in mind, my friends and I had to clean our own fridge using soap and sponges to avoid contaminating the food which we bought from the local supermarket - which is brilliant value for money having paid £1,000 for a week... The room with a single bed, was not only small, dirty, dusty and in dire need of some life - it also had a condom wrapper (not mine) down the side of the bed, which is lovely to see when trying to sleep. Moreover, the bathroom looked like a prisoners bathroom, no windows, no extractor fan, a cheap and dirty floor (leading to my friends and I all buying flip flops), a shower head, a toilet and a sink all next to each other. Additionally, there was pubic hair nicely sitting on the shower drain (none of my friends or mine) meaning either Bas felt like a quick shave before we arrived, or he paid no attention in actually cleaning the bathroom between the last guests and us. The living room, was the best room in the apartment, it was the most spacious, with 2 relatively comfortable sofas, nice big windows to keep circulation and for natural light, as well as a TV. However, there was dust everywhere, the sofas were dirty and we had to take to cleaning that room as well. Surprisingly... Luckily for us, there were roadworks being done on the road outside the apartment, which as unfortunate as it was, was not mentioned by Bas once - which I think was extremely unsatisfactory. Additionally the size of the apartment was barely enough for 3 people, let alone four. Any more people would have made it feel extremely claustrophobic and unpleasant. The room with the double bed was actually quite nice, lacking any character it did its job. On the other hand, the room with 2 single beds (one single bed and a single mattress underneath), was very unpleasant. The sheets smelt and weren't proper duvets; there were..."
-1,"This was an unacceptable apartment and experience. The reason I use AirBnB is because it's convenient and you're able to be in direct contact with the owner/renter should any issues arise. Not in this case, where you're greeting by an uninformed management company acting as a middle man between you and the owner. You have to sign a rental agreement prior to key pickup, then figure your way to the apartment which is almost 2 miles away from key pickup. The apartment didn't have wifi as advertised and the apartment was beyond dirty. There was mold in the shower, water stains that hadn't been cleaned for ages to the point where you couldn't see in the mirror. There were dirty towels on the floor, unclean linens on the bed; dirt, grime, and dust all over the apartment. You're greeted by a strong sulphur/rotten egg smell upon entering. When we reached out to the management company to initially report that the Wifi was down, she said she'd follow up with the owner. When we realized all of the rest of the issues with the listing, we called the management company multiple times, with them ignoring not only us, but AirBnB customer support as well. Thankfully we were able to cancel our reservation and check into a fabulous, clean, properly advertised listing - after 10 hours of back and forth with customer service, on our honeymoon nonetheless, after a 9-hour travel day and a 1.5 mile walk to the listing. We were in Amsterdam on a quick 3-day holiday and essentially lost a day due to this scam of an apartment. I wouldn't recommend this apartment to my worst enemy. Had AirBnB not went into customer service overdrive, this would have been our last time using the service. This listing is very obviously intended to be used as a crash-pad for the young person partying in Amsterdam (hence the unnecessary rental agreement) , NOT for adults looking to experience the more local side to Amsterdam. Truly the most disappointing way to begin a holiday."
1,"Plenty of space and light, well laid out and equipped. A great location to explore the city from, on foot, on bikes or utilising easily accessible public transport links very close. A quiet neighbourhood on the whole yet a two minute walk to De Hallen, brilliant breakfasts and fantastic street market. "
1,"Great apartment, we had everything we needed, good location, there is a supermarkt 100m far away..

Thomas was an excelent host, he recomended us where to go, what to do, he was always avaiable. 

I would really recomend this place to my friends.

The only bad experience I had was that the cat scratch my boots when I left them in the guest door, they were a good ones.

Beside this, everything was good"
0,"The apartment was central closed to a supermarket and some small exotic shops and a nice bar /restaurant. The tram station was 2 minutes away. Perfect without a car :-) 

The room was clean up. The bed a dream. Everything was new.

Only the freezer was dirty and not really cold. Our milk gets to butter. 

The walls are very thin.

We felt fine and Liz and LJarry are very friendly and cooperative :) Thanks!"
0,"Edward was very nice and a very good host.  The location was great with everything we needed close by.  Design was nice, bed was comfortable, everything was clean and worked well.  The neighbors were doing some construction right outside the bedroom and that was a major bummer, Edward tried to help and I appreciated that, the neighbor told him they would wait till 9am to start, but actually most days they started around 7am! It really was very uncomfortable and was a big disappointment.  

If not for the construction it would have been very good.  Assuming there is no construction next door I would recommend this apartment to everyone."
0,The location of the apartment is very good. The host is helpful. But the entrance stairs is awful and dangerous. Also the apartment was not so clean.
0,"This is not a room in a house, is a room in a inn, therefore there is no kitchen and we couldn't find the washing machine, the bathroom is really big and nice, you have to share it with the other guests in the inn, the room is very small and the location is really good, there's a tram stop just a block away, and there are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes near by.
because it's an inn, you have to give the 100 euro deposit in cash."
1,"Nice, clean place in an area close to the centre (four stops on the Metro - 54, 53) from Amsterdam Centraal in a quiet neighbourhood with a good, friendly, safe family as hosts.  Good value for Amsterdam."
0,"This room is a fine place to stay if you are just looking for a crashpad. 

Cons: 
The room is incredibly sparse – with nothing in the room but a bed and dresser and bare walls, even a cough or sneeze echoed unpleasantly in the room. 
Also, the apartment is at the top of 2 extremely steep and narrow flights of stairs. I have knee problems and didn't feel this was properly communicated in advance, probably wouldn't have booked this apt with that knowledge

Pros: The location is fantastic. Yana was also very flexible about arrival and checkout time. The place was quite clean.

Though no fault of Yana's, her boyfriend got food poisoning that first night and spent an hour retching in the bathroom, which shared a wall with my room. It was awful listening to the echoing sounds of puking late into the night. Not much anyone could have done about it, but it definitely affected my stay."
0,Close to central station and cosy place
1,"All fine! Wonderfull light Apartment! 
Communication with the landlord was very easy and nice. Got every Information and answer fast!
We enjoyed our stay a lot. 
"
1,"Wonderful stay in Amsterdam! Andrea is a lovely host, she is very kind and gave us complete privacy, although we shared the bathroom (and the house of course). She has done a list of the best restaurants, cafè, attractions for her guests. The room is really nice, in a green area, very close to the metro station and far cheaper than the average prices of Amsterdam.  We recommend it!!"
1,"Louise is a great host and we enjoyed the stay at her beautiful flat. The room is nicely furnished, the bed is comfy and the breakfast very tasty. Also, the two cats and the little dog are lovely :) The flat is located in a nice neighbourhood, you can walk to the city center in about half an hour. We would really recommend this place! "
1,"I should say something awful so I can keep this place to myself, but that wouldn't be fair on the host. Beautiful apartment, lovely canal views, lively area and close to some great restaurants and nightlife. I have nothing bad to say about it"
1,"Lockbox entry
Good location
Clean
Other bedroom also rented out to airbnb guests
Lots of stairs so good for young people
Good wifi
Quiet area

Overall would stay again"
1,His apartment is very comfortable & convenient. They has a good coffee machine too. I had a bad experience in Paris's apartment. But his apartment made me happy!!    
-1,DO NOT BOOK IT! IT IS WORSE THAN WHAT IT LOOKS AND AIRBNB WILL NOT EVEN PROVIDE YOU WITH A REFUND. HOSTS LIKE THIS SCAM THE GUESTS INTO BOOKING SOMETHING THAT IS RUNDOWN AND SUBSTANDARD.
1,The apartment was great! The location was great as well and right next to the Albert Cuyp market. My flight arrived well ahead of the check-in time and J let me check-in early! Would highly recommend!
-1,"We have been asked to provide a 150 Euros cash deposit...(surprised) than 100Euros was accepted. We were 4 brothers & for 1 night a friend have joined us at 2 am & we told her to stay at the apartment & not to leave...
5 min later, the host came in the room, had a small nice chat with us... came back 5 min later treating us as cheater because we tried to hide (completely wrong) our friend & told us that we lost our deposit and we he will ""kick us out""
I am an AirBnb host and I will never treat my guest in this way!!
30min negotiation @2am to stay with our friend in the room (no bed, she slept on the ground) and we  lost our deposit!
Very bad experience in general... really disappointed! Never again!"
-1,"Horrible place. 
First of, this is no 'room in appartment' this is straight up an awful hostel. It is not at the location listed on this site - it is close by, but that on itself is worrying.
The hostel is extremely loud. I was woken up at 3am by general noises (probably also the restaurant downstairs). 
Bathroom was mouldy and extremely dirty, as far as I can tell used by a lot of people. 
Room is alright, as listed here.
Wifi very weak, no internet most of the time."
1,"We stayed here as a last minute booking due to be scammed on line.
Thomas and Masha responded very quickly and were very helpful with the booking.
It was a beautiful house and setting for me and a group of friends to celebrate my 50th birthday.
The only thing was that 2 people had to sleep in living room which meant we weren't able to use the terrace as freely as we would have wanted.
The house was very clean and had everything we needed for an enjoyable weekend away.
Cats were no trouble at all and seemed used to visitors.
I would  recommend this to anyone looking for a getaway to Amsterdam..... thank you"
1,"Gina and her husband were extremely welcoming and friendly. I arrived almost 24 hours late because of a delayed flight, and their hospitality definitely made me forget the bad experience I had before arriving. The bed was super comfortable. The place is located in a great location near supermarkets, stores and bus stations, and a walkable distance from the Centraal station."
-1,"DO NOT RECOMMEND!
I was renting the houseboat bout for 8 days during october 2015.
Firstly I never met Mirjam the real house owner all I got was a contact man how came to welcome us but didn't know anything about the boat reaptly saying I don't know how to unlock this or where is what.
The living room has bad air circulation and the first glass is unmoveable. The second glass has two moveable part the one close to the living room is locked with screw! the owner does not want you to have normal circulation of air in the appartment!
that wasn't all!!!!!
the owner took from me at the reservetion Cleaning fee of 37 Dollars and as we arrived to the houseboat the ""host"" (contact man)  took from us aditional 100 euros guarantee for if we break something. at the end of the trip we CLEANED the houseboat leaving for him only to clean the floor (2 min top) and we didnt clean the dishes (8-10 min) and the wet towels, the ""host"" gave us back only 50 EUROS! saying that we did to much mess! (Nothing was broken) 
I Have photos of how we left the houseboat i would give them to how ever want so you can see what is the definition of the ""host"" for additional 50 euros of cleaning after we already paid 37 dollars for that!
you think its all?
No no no we were 3 people living there before i reserved this houseboat i asked her if the apartment is good for 3 she said of course! i will open an extra bed for you we found out that the extra bad wasn't even a real bed it was hard as hell, small (my feet was out of the bad and part of my hands) and if you slept on it you would wake up with alot of pain! one of us had to sleep on the sofa with was awfull but better then the folding bad.
Still it doesn't end! the owner promised 2 bikes as i arrived and asked the ""host"" where the key's and the bike are he didn't know (like anything else) and only after two days at amsterdam he told me he found where they should be and he can give us them now. after we already rent 3 bikes rather than 1.
to sum up: 
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else.
Don't take this houseboat search something else."
1,"The weather was awful during our stay in Amsterdam, so I am very happy we got to stay at Tes' beautiful, tasteful, bright and welcoming gem of a place. We listened to LPs and drank some tea while looking out the window (stunning canal view). When we braved the rain to go to the centre, it was steps away - we did not even buy transportation passes. Tes' boyfriend Auke was there to welcome us, he was very nice and gave us some tips to visit the city.
We would happily return."
1,"Great place. Close to public transportation, clean, very convenient on all levels."
1,"We had great days in Amsterdam.  The apartment was perfect and everything worked out perfectly. Jan was a great host and welcomed us with a welcome prosecco. The location of the apartment is perfect, the metro is just around the corner.    Everything was clean and we had everything we needed.  So I can only recommend it."
-1,"The key has to be picked up and the check-in is 3pm. So i have asked to pick up the key earlier and hence check in earlier. Was confirmed, but not really known when i showed up. 
Once arrived, the apartment wasnt cleaned, the host said it will be clean by 3pm. 
At 2:30 the cleaning guy arrives, if I wouldnt have instructed to get rid of all the spiders in the living room and take of shoes when making a bed, i believe this would have resulted in a very bad experience. 
In between i got insulted of stealing a key from the guest before, which was just rude. 
At 3:30 the apartment was finally clean and we could move in and take a shower. 
The bed room has NO WINDOW, which means you have to leave te door open and get fresh air from the living room. That is very tough, as its groundfloor and you dont leave the window open during night or when left the apartment.
The apartment is not very central and always involves some walking. For what I paid, I would not use this again. Instead i would pay a few euros more and spend more central and nicer. 

Too expensive for what u get!"
0,"Judith is very nice and welcoming .
Negatives of the apartment: 20 minutes by bus from the central station. Low soundproofing the apartment. The ceiling of the shower has undergone significant leaks ( paint to peel ) and the wall above the toilet doors  are damaged.Problème for littering ( he would have needed a card !). One small saucepan and one frying pan (the other two pans are rusty ) !. The plates are chipped . The wings of bed in the corners are damaged and rescotchés . The washing machine has its front panel rusty .
Pros: there is a grocery store next door at the bottom affordable prices. The 33 bus that goes downtown every 7 minutes. On the same line you can get to a mall . There are also night buses (but more expensive) . Otherwise, the ticket is valid for one hour to 2.80 euros. The apartment is warm. The white carpet is nice ( a little stained ) and the small couch is (a little stained ) also . The bed is comfortable. The bedding is clean. Clean towels are provided and toilet paper and cleaning products were providedOverall , it's pretty clean and well lit ."
-1,"Disappointing !
Very Bad experience with the host and the apartment.
 
As agreed with Mr. Sammy  we tried to phone him once  arrived at Amsterdam Central  Station . No answer from him. 
After so many phone attempt  and  messages  we get a text replay  an hour later saying  he will be at the apartment 14:05 . First Disappointment.
 
We managed to reach the apartment at 14:10. He handed over the keys and gave us the WiFi password. He didn't show or explain anything about the apartment . Before leaving he mentioned, we can reach him anytime between 14:00 to 22:00 if anything needed. (but he never picked up or messaged us for the entire stay)

We noticed house was smelling moldy, towels were smelling bad, tiny dust mites on the sofa and bed. I caught allergy with this! there are no kitchen towels and dish-washing gel. 
We left home to have some lunch, and evening we noticed the heaters are not working. we tried calling him many times from evening (Day 1) no response at all. it was a very cold night and floors were damn cold, there are no house slippers provided nor the floor mats. This is the time we regretted booking this apartment and coming all the way from India!
 
Day 2 morning we tried to reach him, yet again no response. I dropped a message to airbnb, saying host is not bothered at all! but still he didn't call us or made some time to come home and show about the alternate heating system,  then we saw a portable small electric heater and one small electric heater behind the TV. If this was the case, he would have mentioned about this at the time of giving the keys! Day 2 night sleep was warm with this. But still not a good experience paying so much money for staying. 

In the description its mentioned king size bed in the bedroom, its actually not. Its two single beds joined together and that's not king size overall! 1.5 toilet in the description was misleading for us, we thought its 1 full bathroom with toilet, and 1 separate toilet. 
Toilet is very very small and the floor is very cold to keep our foot! 

After Day 2 we never tried to reach him nor he did, we never bothered to call him at the checkout, we were very irritated with overall experience. we booked this apartment after reading so many good reviews, it seems we should not relay on reviews. 

After sharing our experience with airbnb, they promised us to refund 30% of the money spent. it was great customer service from airbnb. Sorry to say, this will be my first and last bookings in here! I would book a hotel for all my next travels, tell my family and friends that staying in hotel is more safe and we get 24x7 help in case there is any emergency."
-1,"The flat has nice location. There are shops, cafes, restaurants near the apartments. 
But I would like to say some words about this apartments. Our Triple bed room with own Bathroom was awful! The room was very dirty, the bed linen was not changed and there was a lot of hair on the sheets! Our room had bathrobes and towels everywhere and looks like used. 
What is under your bed? If you only saw socks, candy wrappers, bracelet, worn carpet. This apartment has no heating, very damp and cold. It seems that before our arrival there was no any cleaning . 
And bathroom with toilet - a total disgrace. 
In the shower there was no door and all the water poured on the floor, draining the water does not dry - just an abomination. I have a few photos confirming my words. If you are going to Amsterdam, do not book this apartment!"
1,We had a great stay in Amsterdam in Andreas apartment. It had all we needed and Andrea was very kind and helpful! I would defenetly recommend others to stay at her place! 
-1,"we were very disapointed by the appartement,
everything was dirty we had to clean every thing before settling down.
We never eated at the appartement because the kitchen was awfuly dirty and I won't talk of all the grease that was in the fridge and everywhere.
The cats were cute except that they vomited in our beds and 
they walked all over the furniture in the kitchen and in the living room, it was a little bit annoying when we wanted to eat something.
The photos are not like reality. When we leaved the apprtement we had to wait 4 hours for Lashaa to awnser us on the phone and we had to leave without seeing him.
We dont recommend this flat."
-1,"All in all:
The beds are two cheap, uncomfortable single beds, the pillows and bedding provided are unclean and inadequate (mattress topper being used as a duvet with no cover, sheets which don’t fit the bed, very old cheap pillows). The room is far too warm as the boiler is directly above the bed meaning the windows need to be permanently open, there are drunk people in the street keeping you awake until 5am, there is a serious mosquito problem and we were bitten all over. The hygenine is awful- blood stains and live/ dead insects over the walls, we found used socks in the bed, other people’s hairs around the room. 
A broken window and the terrible hygenine and other problems were photographed and reported to the homeowner on the first night and nothing was done. He said he would send a ‘cleaner’ and no one came at all. The shower facilities are simply a cord running from the bath. The room is cramped and the adjoining apartment opens out right to the door as well as being behind a paper thin wall, leaving little or no privacy. The homeowner was not present but was abrasssive and unhelpful when contracted offering simply to send ‘a cleaner’ who never appreared. 
£120 a night to have no sleep, be covered in insect bites, unclean and uncomfortable with no help from the owner. Shocking. 
"
1,"The apartment was lovely exactly how it looked in the pictures. Marta kept contact before arriving which was reassuring as I had a bad experience with my first Airbnb host. She explained everything throughout the apartment too which was great and I had a lovely stay in the apartment. The ferry ride across every day was lovely and location is very central and location was lovely too. I wasn't aware of the extra €30 cleaning costs as its usually included in the total figure but that was my own fault for not reading through thoroughly. Also I found it stressful trying to find the apartment  and had told Marta my flight was arriving at 2pm so would get there by 3pm and felt under strain to arrive at this time when I received text messages asking where I was that she was rushing out. This was the only downfall, whereas if you book with a hotel, there is no time pressure to arrive to get keys. Marta also did kindly let us leave our bags in the apartment on our last day when we were supposed to be checked out as we had a late flight back."
1,"What a great apartment & great host! Located just off a charming street, across from the metro, Constanze's place was perfect for our group of 5 visiting Amsterdam for a long weekend. We were met in person and given plenty of recommendations for things to see and do, and the apartment itself was spacious, stylish & clean. (The view from the balcony is wonderful!) I'd highly recommend this place for any small group or family as a ""home base"" for exploring Amsterdam!"
0,"Great location and view out the living room. Shower is also perfect for tall people. I'm very tall so very happy to find a place where the shower head is high enough for me to stand up  :) Also like the high ceilings in the living room and big kitchen. Tons of room in this two-level place. Bedroom and bathroom are downstairs, living room and kitchen are upstairs.

This could be an amazing AirBNB, but definitely missing some details. Customer service is awful. Already talked about that. The kitchen faucet was broken and a beeping noise in the bedroom coming from the electrical box. They said both things would be fixed in 3 days, but never happened (I stayed for 7 days).  Had to make a run to the store to get soap. Bed is two single mattresses with queen sheets. Pretty uncomfortable for a tall person trying to sleep diagonally across the gap between the two mattresses. Curtains in the bedroom are see-through. This allows street lights to come in at night and people can see in if you have the light on. Also gets bright when the sun comes up. I slept on the couch upstairs most nights and that worked out great.

Overall, could be a great place with a few adjustments like a queen mattress and new blackout bedroom curtain. Hopefully the owner will change the management company Welcome Back. If those things happen, I'd recommend this place."
1,"Nadia is very kind and accommodating. She provided us with information about public transportation and things to do during the booking process. 

The room is very cosy and had everything we needed. There's hot water for tea, coffee -  and even noodles - which made for a pleasant surprise. 

The subway station is just around the corner and takes you to the city center in fifteen minutes, which is very convenient. 

I would definitely stay here again!"
1,"My second stage in the apartment was great.
After a bad experience in another place I wanted to come back here where I always felt like my home.
The apartment was painted and looks fresh.
With Ej very good feelings."
1,"Thank u for the hospitality, the apartment was in very nice erea, and Judith, was the nicest lady we met in amstrdam, thank you :)"
1,"Jan was an awesome host! She was very pleasant and accommodating despite not giving more advance notice of my arrival time.  (wrote her about an hour prior which wasn't fair to her. I felt awful making her rush to meet me. And she understood and was very pleasant)  The fresh croissants, Daelmans Original Dutch Caramel Wafers and toiletries were a nice touch. The apartment was just as pictured in the profile and it was very clean. I had plenty of room and loved the large windows that allowed in the natural light and air. 

The apartment location was in walking distance to the museum area ,Vondelpark and lots of shops, restaurants, etc.  Depending on how much time you have and a good pair of walking shoes, you can walk all the way to Central Station and everything in between. I did that twice over the weekend. It's a great way to see the city and get in some exercise. 

I would definitely recommend Jan's apartment and would rent from Jan again when I come back to visit the great city of Amsterdam and all it has to offer! :) "
-1,"Me and my family of 5 spent 3 days in Thalita's house. 
The house is in excellent location. It is quiet and a walking distance from district 9 and Anna Frank house. Also close to shops, restaurants and more.
The House is big and spacious and fits families as well as group of friends. We had along travel before we arrived and at some point we noticed we are going to be late, we called Talitha and she was nice and cooperative to arrange someone to give us the keys since she could not wait for us.
However, the house is old. There is a smell of wet mold in the entrance as well as in the bathroom. 
The house in general need some maintenance - towel hanger missing at the toilets, stained sofa and general feeling that the house is not clean (it looked to us as if the photos in airbnb reflect a previous,  better condition of the house) . When we checked in the host requested additional 50 Euros cleaning fee which were not mentioned before.  This was improper especially since we got the house with trash and leftovers of previous visitors in the closets and the bathroom.
Overall it was a disappointment to us but we tried to focus on the good side of the great location.
Additional tip: you will get one towel per person. If you need more ask for it in advance.
"
1,"Excellent apartment, very clean and well equipped. It has all you need and very close to the center on foot and all other commodities.
I won't hesitate to rent again !"
1,"I was very well welcomed by Mirjam. She is a very friendly person. I was looking for a safe and clean place to stay in Amsterdam with easy access to public transportation. It is exactly what her home offers. In addition of being close to the city center, you can enjoy the tranquility and greenery. Without any hesitation, I recommend Mirjam's place to everybody. "
1,The boathouse and patio were picture perfect. We loved sitting on the back porch and watching the boats and ducks float by. Liz was a fantastic host and was so easy to connect with! Excellent place!
-1,"We faced a lot of problems finding the House.
It was very cold and rainy morning, we had to wait outside for about an hour in the rain till our host handed over the  keys and there were already some guys in the house who had'nt checked out yet, it was bad experience. It kinda killed our excitement. We left the house soon to city central. This house is quite far from the city center,it will take 25 to 30 min to reach.
I would not recommend for others to stay here. "
1,"Andrea was indeed an amazing host! We've spent almost three weeks there and we had total privacy. Also, she helped us with extra tourist info about the city and checked e.g. the opening hours of a swimming pool for us - even prior our arrival. Thank you again!

(The neighbourhood is quiet, the centre is 20 minutes by metro. Shops are close.)"
-1,"A cozy motorboat? Just another way of saying a tiny space, a tiny space which leaked the whole time during the torrential downpour that plagued our entire visit. 

The bed was inadequate due to the wooden plank in the middle falling anytime you sat on the bed.
 
The boat has no electric so candles where provided but no lighter or matches, this was an issue because I don't smoke so don't carry a lighter. 

Full of spiders and mosquito's so you're in for a treat if you're into that. 

Horrible smell in the boat the whole time. Actually rang to explain I'd be late to check in and have had no response so it seems that when you pay that's it! No help is given whatsoever. 

Actually surprised the boat floats. 
Yes its budget but its not like I'm expecting 5 star luxury, just not to be rained on through the night. 

Overall quite a bad experience using this host.

1,"Sheila is a friendly person and a great host. Her house is very comfortable with a great view.just that we had a lot of luggage and carrying it 3 floors on steps and another floor inside the house was a bit of a task for us. But for anyone with less luggage, this place is superb."
1,"Mirjam was so lovely, she was so helpful, and answered all my many questions about transport, shopping and eating in Amsterdam.  Her place is so conveniently located, quiet, clean and spacious, and has a view of a lovely green part of the city.  I would definitely go back :-)"
-1,"★★☆☆☆
We had a very BAD experience! All of this began after the booking: a message informed us that address was different in another area of Amsterdam; Twan confirmed explicitly the address!
Because our flight arrival was expected at the midnight, we informed Twan about any issues with it and he guaranteed it was ok and don't worry, saying that we arrange a meeting place to get the keys.
When we arrived in Amsterdam, he sent a message on Airbnb portal, informing us the keys were in a place next to the flat; so we go to the flat and started to find keys. 
Unfortunately, there was NOT any keys, so we tried to contact Twan and his agency both with phone number and Airbnb portal. 
Phone number was not available in the night and we left a message on his voice mail; meanwhile we wrote many messages to Twan using Airbnb portal, asking him an emergency number or to call us in order to solve this problem. 
NOTHING!! 
We receive answers from Twan once every hour in portal and there were NOT any solutions, while we were OUTSIDE IN THE NIGHT WITH LUGGAGES.
Moreover all rooms in nearest hotels were all booked! At about 4.00 a.m. after we pushed again for a solution, we received a message that flat address was WRONG, and it was the first address when we booked the apartment!
So we moved with our luggage to the other flat (about 5 km far), but the keys were NOT even there! 
We stayed all the night outside in the street around Amsterdam suburbs!!!
We finally check in the apartment after the 2nd day, when another guy of the same Twan's company arrived with the keys. He gave us delicious dutch cookies… one star is for them!! 
The flat was just like photos, we expected basic soap or other washing up liquid but there weren't. Under the bed and the fridge weren't perfectly clean… there were some stuff left by previous guest.
We don't know if the problem was Twan (is he real ?!?! ) or his company, however we had a bad experience with this host, so we asked a refund for the first night."
0,"The apartment is very nice and it's very well located. We didn't feel so comfortable with two things:
1) We told Valeria we were arriving to the apartment to do the check in between 17.30 and 18.30. We had so many different difficulties to arrive (such as a delay on the bus from the airport, problems to buy metro tickets, finding the apartment) and that made us being late. We arrived at 19.00. There was waiting for us a Valeria's friend who was very nervous because of our delay. We think that if you rent an apartment by Airbnb the host should know that sometimes, turist could be late because of unknowing the city so should be a little more patient.
2) The towels had an awful smell."

-1,"Location is okay. However, the check-in arrangement was disappointing.  This place included both 1/F & 2/F. When we arrived the apartment at agreed check-in time, only 2/F was clean up & ready. 1/F was still cleaning. The host who name Mark seems not responsible for 1/F, and couldn't give an exact time of when 1/F could be ready. He only force us to listen to house rule etc but ignore all the questions about 1/F. In the end, need to wait 3 more hours before 1/F was ready. 

Also, during the last day of our stay, we saw a rat running out from 1/F kitchen. 

This is really a bad experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone. "
1,"We did not meet Sophie, but she had arranged everything to make us easier to check in and out of her apt. Communication with her was great and she was very responsive on our suggestions (privacy, blinds, lamps on-off switch). Great host. Location was great, very near to morning market where we can find anything at cheap price! Also, safe neigborhood where you can just walk enjoying the area. Recommended place for the price."
1,"Our stay was perfect and we did not have any issues. Despite a late arrival due to flight delay, Anouk organized to leave us the keys. She was also kind enough to leave us tips on the city. The apartment is nicely decorated and we really loved the little terrace (especially during the heatwave at night!). Central station and the city center can be easily reached  by tram."
1,Great place ! I was very satisfied with my stay 
1,very nice apartment in a central location.  communicative host. allowed us to early check-in. stairs are rather steep so  be prepared.

Location, in a residential place. 
Otherwise Amsterdam is beautiful !!

"
0,It was nice! But a little bit far away from the center but you can use the public transport late night...
0,"The location couldn't be better. Close to the Central Station and most of the prime sites in Amsterdam. Hamad was great about responding to questions prior to our arrival and was very punctual in meeting at the agreed upon time to pass off keys. Hamad is a polite and friendly man. Unfortunately, the room was a bit of a disappointment regarding its size and amenities. It is quite small and the shower stands in the middle of the room next to the kitchenette. There is no bathroom sink, so one must wash hands and brush teeth in the kitchen sink. Though the place was clean, it has a bit of a grungy, DIY feel to it. Coming and going was not a problem and there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. If very narrow and steep stairs are a problem, this wouldn't be for you. It was not a problem for us though."
1,"The room is very nice and cosy. I was a little bit concerned about the cats before arriving as I previously had a bad experience but I was happy to see that everything was kept perfectly clean. Shireen is very friendly, easy going and accommodating, which made my stay very comfortable. The apartment is a little away from the centre but is really well connected by tram. Thanks a lot for everything!"
1,Lovely flat!
1,"We had a great time in Niels' apartment. It was clean, and it had everything you might need. It's 2 minutes walk from a tram stop that takes you to the city center. There are supermarkets and restaurants near by.

Niels was an amazing host, easy to talk to and very kind. We wanted to visited Giethoorn, a village near Amsterdam, and since he was travelling that day, he gave us a ride to a city near by.

We totally recommend staying here!"
1,"Very beautiful apartment, so bright and calm, with an amazing view on the seaside: we have had a marvelous stay at Sandra's place — excellent hosting!"
-1,"My colleague and I stayed in a home managed by Michiel and Jane's company, and unfortunately our experience was incredibly disappointing. It is clear that there are some communication issues between the employees working for this company. 

While coordinating our check-in, I had to ask the same question three times before I got an answer. Additionally, I was asked for my phone number at least twice even though I had provided it the first time it was requested. 

My colleague and I arrived about an hour earlier than our scheduled check-in time so we informed the host. Rather than letting us know if we could check-in earlier than we had planned, we got a response welcoming us to the home. Upon calling the host to find out what to do, we were told that we could not check-in until 2130 - thirty minutes later than we had previously scheduled. 

Upon getting into the apartment it was discovered the door was unlocked and partially opened. The man that arrived to check us in was really the only redeeming part of our stay. He was incredibly helpful and friendly.

Unfortunately, the information he had regarding the WiFi access was incorrect and had to contact his colleague. Shortly after he left and called his colleague, we received a message telling us the incorrect WiFi access information (which was communicated to his colleague while he was still at the apartment). We never did get the WiFi access information, and I suspect the host still has no idea what it is.

Overall, we were incredibly disappointed with how this experience turned out, and it was definitely NOT worth the hassle or the money. I hope that our experience was unique to us and not indicative of how Michiel and Jane do business. Either way, I will never stay in an AirBnB that is managed by them or their company.

TL;DR - They got two stars because the location was excellent, and because the man that checked us into the apartment was fantastic. Pretty much everything else about this experience was just awful."
1,"Room is cozy and clean.Most of all , I learned things from Paul and Miranda (website hidden) sure to have dinner with them."
1,"Staying in Amsterdam was a unique experience. The apartment was about a 25 minute walk from the central train station but it is a prettt nice walk. In the beginning there were a few communication issues (before arrival) but it wasn't anyone's fault because as a traveller from Mexico, I don't have a phone with me unless I'm connected to wi-fi so that complicated things.

The apartment was nice, specially for the price. As said, it is kind of far from the center but the area is very nice. There were a couple of things that could be fixed (which I spoke to Sam about) and I understand the situation about the apartment. Considering we were the second booking, it was a very pleasant stay.

Finally, the most important thing. Samoul was incredibly nice, awfully kind and funny. He made us feel like friends and that meant a lot. I saw him in check-in and check-out only but we had a very nice conversation. 

This is definitely a great choice for Amsterdam."
1,"Wow! This place is just beautiful. This apartment is so cosy, had so much character and was teamed with a beautiful view of the Prinsengracht canal. Catalina had decked out the apartment with all of the essentials that you could need. There was construction out the front but this didn't bother us at all. 
I highly recommend it!!!"
-1,The location of the apartment is pretty nice but the inside is just full of lie compared to pics. The bathroom had an handle broken. The smell was awful. It was dirty and the couch was so full of stains that I couldn't sit on. The beds were just The worst
1,Andrea has been an excellent host right from the beginning. She was very helpful in giving tips and recommendations. She also made sure that we know how to get to the airport on the last day we stayed with her. I will definitely consider staying with her again if I ever visit Amsterdam in the future.
0,"Sepp's studio is in a good location; in 15 minutes walk from the city centre. Sepp gave very clear instructions how to get there, where to find and where to leave the key. Studio is small, but enough for 2 person. The main thing, which disappointed me, was a strong smell of Indian incense sticks in the flat! The smell is very strong, even bed smells awful. "
1,"It was such a special experience staying on a houseboat during our visit to Amsterdam! It is well located close to everything, and Friedrich was a great host. It is a tiny space but adorable and well cared for, with everything we needed for a week-long stay. Friedrich went out of his way to make us feel at home and offered some great local tips."
1,"Great host, great apartment, easy and quick communication and useful tips for your trip to Amsterdam "
1,This was hands down the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. Everything was absolutely perfect. Could have asked for anything more.   I'm almost speechless as to have perfect this place is. 
1,"Overall we had a great stay on the boat, it made a nice change from an over priced hotel room and we would definitely use it again when we return. Our flight was delayed so unfortunately had to drag Ivan out to greet us at 21:30 at night (sorry). He was a very nice friendly guy that offered us advice on where to find local shops and the weekend market which is well worth a Saturday visit and only around the corner. 

The location of the boat was great, easy to find and only about 15 minutes walk from central station which in turn is only about 15 minutes ride from the airport. Anne Frank's house is just down the road and less than 10 minutes walk and most other areas are also within walking distance or a short tram ride if you'd prefer. At night the area is quiet and also not much different during the day and it was nice to have the bench outside to sit and watch the world pass by especially in the early mornings when everyone is cycling to work/school.

The boat is nice and warm and generally comfortable but is unfortunately let down by the bed(s). The master bedroom bed is not the most comfortable and is incredibly noisy with any movement from you or your partner making the springs make an awful squeaking noise. Although I personally didn't sleep on the sofa bed it was easy to assemble and was reasonably comfortable I am told. 

Some of my photos from our trip and the local area can be seen here (website hidden)"
-1,"This was  our first Air BnB experience and unfortunately, compared to the two others since, we would have to say that this was a very disappointing start in our travels. First, we had no front door key to get in day after day( even on the fourth day when we left) and had to rely on calling and waiting each time to get in-not good!! Second, it was on the fourth floor of a steeply inclined, dirty stairway-again not too good ! However,our biggest disappointments were with 1) a small,barren sparsely appointed bedroom with an on the floor mattress.(no chair,no table,no place to hang anything)  2) a poorly stocked kitchen with a non-functioning  dishwasher,dishes always everywhere and 1970's student furniture,like a cheap hostel. 3) Friends of the host coming to ""crash"" and no toilet paper one day.
Unless you are expecting a $10.00/day place just to sleep we would not recommend this to others despite the fact Julia and Kim were friendly and often there.

1,"Fantastic host, amazing apartment, perfect location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place. Thanks again for having us."
1,A very good flat in Amsterdam. Very well comunicated by metro and tram with centrum or station train. Very close to the city center (5-10 mins approx).
-1,Awful place.  Hot water didn't work. Mice in apartment.  Attacked and ate our food. Was in the bed! Left and checked into hotel.  They told us and AirBnB they will refund us and cover cost of hotel but now won't speak to AirBnB despite AirBnB and my efforts.  We are now taking legal action and seeking compensation.  Ruined our trip completely.  We have them over a week to sort it out and refund us without leaving a bad review or anything and they haven't.  DO NOT STAY YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
1,"Loved this place. Erik and Marguerit were very flexible with some technicalities I had to work through with Airbnb, which was sincerely appreciated. The place was very clean, and larger than we expected. The ladder/steps below deck are steep, so keep that in mind. We also used the deck up top with a table and chairs, and a great view. About a 20 minute walk to Amsterdam Centraal, and we easily walked around the city. A few shops nearby that weren’t too crowded, as it is a little further from downtown. I would highly recommend this place! It was great for wanting to be close to everything, but not too close that everything is loud and crowded right outside your window. "
1,"Bram & Maartje’s apartment was a fantastic place a comfortable week’s stay in Amsterdam. Right on the canal. Cozy kitchen and living room, plenty of space. They were incredibly proactive, nice, and responsive during all of our communications. Wonderful hosts - I’d highly recommend their place for a stay! "
1,"Nice place, great location. Could be a little cleaner but overall not a bad experience. We arrived early and were accommodated and had beers on the house. The place was big enough for the 3 of us and everyone had a comfortable sleep. Thank you!"
0,"As he was working at night, me and my two friends just saw Malagueta the first day when we arrived his home. He was kind. 
The appartment was clean. 
The room was very tiny for 3 people and, in my opinion, overvaluated. The days, me and my friends, stayed at Malagueta's, where 7 in the appartment and just 1 bathroom. 
The appartment is well located: 20 minutes of citycentre and 15 from Central station. 
It is definitely not my best stay on Airbnb, but not a bad experience. If I could, I will choose another place in Ámsterdam."
0,"The description was accurate, the place is clean and nice. Only one problem, the guys who manage this. They are not the owners, they manage a bunch of properties.

We got to Amsterdam at 9am and the check in was supposed to be at 3pm. I asked for some flexibility, even if it was 1 or 2 hours before that time as we would be really tired of walking around plus we would leave flat at 8am on Friday (when the check out is supposed to be at 11am approx). 

They told us they couldn't do anything, that we could drop our bags in a place for cheap called Drop & Go (Cheap = 13 euros for 2 carry on for a couple of hours) and that they would give us the keys at 3pm. What they never clarified before booking is that they will give the keys to us in central Amsterdam, in the same place where we dropped our bags, and not in the property, that meant that we didn't get to flat until 3:30 / 4pm. Where's the 3pm check in then?? 

Seen this, first I was wondering why they weren't flexible, and the reason is just because they are lazy and they would rather go to central Amsterdam at 3pm and meet all the Airbnb hosts they have and give them the keys to all in one place. In this way they don't need to travel around the city and its easier for them. So we just waited walking around amsterdam for 5 to 6  hours with 30 degrees after waking up at 4am to catch my flight :) :) :)

THIS IS NOT WHAT AIRBNB IS SUPPOSED TO BE, this is companies making properties more expensive, charging the owners fees and giving an awful service to the hosts. Airbnb should make something about this, plus when we got to the apartment wifi was not working. 

Thanks Twan for understanding your hosts and being so flexible."
-1,"The communication with the owner was terrible she and kept out all the time! 

It started so that we 3 weeks ago asked whether we can previously apartment to let off our suitcases because our flight lands at 9 o'clock in the morning. 
They said no problem and for this reason we booked this apartment. 

So we then arrived it was said it was not possible because more guests in the apartment! Allegedly required 2 days between each new guests apartment to be cleaned? So, that was not the case too! Our check in was only 4 pm ! 
Not as discussed at 9 am and not like in the description given at 2 pm! 

When we then came in to the apartment it was still not finished! 

We had no bedding all days 
we asked the host but then no reply! 
So we had to sleep 4 days long without linen! 

Not to mention the cleanliness! The apartment was so dirty all cobwebs dirt and grime! The dishwasher was full of scruffy and dried dishes! 
Horrible! 

The best was still so the hostess and said yes how can her apartment but left and go if it doesn't fit us to a hotel? 
Please what ? we have paid €2000 for 3 Nights and then also clean and bedding and friendly service await! 

The host was rude, not helpful and the service of air bnb awful! No help from anyone impertinence! 

Never booket hier again! 

If you need help no one feels responsible "
1,Amazing hospitality and quick responses. I was checking-in very late and they accommodated my check-in and even thoughtfully contacted me when they heard the train I was going to take was having issues. Saskia and Bastiaan were very welcoming.
1,"Our group of six had a wonderful time in this beautiful home. The location is in a pleasant, walkable neighbourhood, with nearby restaurants, (food) shops, and the extensive Vondelpark. A tram stop is a few steps away, making for convenient trips into central Amsterdam. 

The bedrooms were clean and comfortable, and the home had communal space to get together in the kitchen/dining/outside, as well as enough space to spread out too. The three floors are connected by steep stairs (typical of this kind of house), so this should be taken into account, as the showers are on the upper floor and the kitchen/dining on the lower.

The pre-arrival communication and check-in were very smooth, with useful information provided about local restaurants, neighbourhood stores, and Amsterdam activities. A very positive experience for our first Airbnb rental, definitely recommended.
"
1,"Very nice hotel in a dead neighborhood, great concept for light travelers, friendly staff, clean shared bathrooms, the small size secret bookcase room are awfully small, you can hardly open the door because of the lack of space to the bed, avoid if you have suitcases. "
1,The propert and location were absolutely magical.
0,"The room is ok, spacious and comfortable. The location is also good, convenient to the main museums and tramway to central station. The bathroom is just too small, and if people with heavy luggage not recommend to live here as the room is at the 4th floor with very narrow stairways. "
-1,"Here's how the scam works:

- List an AirBnB in a popular location for a reasonable price.
- About five hours before the guest checks in, tell them that there is a ""problem"" with the room, and direct them to stay in a completely different room than what was advertised.
- Since the guest has such short notice, all of the alternative AirBnBs are already rented, or prices have gone up.  You've got them right where you want them.  They have little choice but to accept!
- If the guest does not accept, then try to trick them into canceling, so that they have to eat the AirBnB fees and you don't.
- Rinse and repeat, until AirBnB shuts down your scam.  Luckily, there's not much to worry about there."
1,"Jurjen was a great host. We flew in early and he was there to let us in and help the place get cleaned earlier than 3PM (usual check in time). This was SO appreciated as we had flown 10 hours and my kids were exhausted. 

The flat has a great location. The fourth floor unit has a deck that is wonderful in the AM for breakfast and also great for a beer in the afternoon. The flat is clean and well organized. 

This flat does not have AC. We were stuck in an awful heat wave (as was the rest of Amsterdam). Small fans were inadequate. Jerjen tried to find larger fans for us but the entire city was sold out. I think in a flat with no AC that these fans may be required for rare instances when it is really hot.

Overall, enjoyed the flat and definitely a good stay if visiting Amsterdam."
-1,"If you are thinking of booking this place, don't. The worst Airbnb we have ever stayed in. This is all done through an agency which we didn't realise (not sure this is even allowed on Airbnb). The person who ""welcomed"" us was late, gave us the keys, and left - our welcome lasted about 30 seconds... 

We got into the flat, made our beds and noticed a funny smell - it was the bed sheets. They must have been washed and then left in the washing machine for a while. It smelt like wet dog, sp unpleasant and disgusting. It made me feel quite sick to be honest.

On our departure day we were told we had to be gone by 11, which was absolutely fine until the cleaners decided to turn up at 10:45 when we were still getting ready. We felt completely rushed. 

Last but not least, this flat is advertised as a 2 double bedroom place, and it definitely is not. I even double-checked this and got written confirmation that it was 2 bedrooms before booking, but when we arrived we realised it was a one bedroom place with a sofa bed in the lounge. The sofa bed was awful, the most uncomfortable thing I have slept on, they clearly wanted to save money and bought the cheapest sofa ""bed"" (not sure you can refer to it as a bed to be honest). 

Fair to say we will definitely not be going back, the worst experience I have had on Airbnb by far. Do not book this place - it's falsely advertised, the sheets are disgusting, and the fact that it's managed through an agency completely goes against everything Airbnb is about.

"
1,"Thanks to Antoinette and her family! The house was really great, and the welcome was perfect. Even with an horrible weather, it was an amazing trip!"
1,"Dominique's boyfriend welcomed us and and made us feel welcome. The apartment is just a short walk from the Centrum and from Centraal Station. Everything was clean and well set up for visitors. I would not recommend this apartment for anyone who has trouble climbing stairs as it is on the top floor and they are quite steep, but otherwise it is a great place to stay, would definitely recommend."
1,"I had a great pleasure to stay in this apartment! Lasha is very friendly, kind and funny, I'm glad I know him! In the apartment there are all conveniences, if you need something - Lasha will help you. Good location. Thank you one more time, and say hello to both lovely cats. I will return for sure there!! 100% recommend."
-1,"The apartment is located away from the center in a very isolated area , the nearest supermarket is a 15 minute walk and it was really tiring. The price of the house is really too high .
Adjoining apartment with two other , no privacy . 
The door did not lock and we could not be quiet ever.
Bad Experience. 
Not recommend."
1,"Very cozy, Calm and good neghborhood, Spaceious, Great choice to stay with family and friends also. Metro is in 5 min walk and it goes straight to the center. "
-1,"the house is located in a quiet neighborhood near Museumplein, it is well connected near to the tram stop.
the problem is the presence of mouse in the apartment, so that we could not use the kitchen or sleep in peace. damn!
claire unfortunately does not live close, so we had to try to plug the holes in the apartment.
bad experience"
-1,"I will definitely thing twice to go back to this apartment. The neighbourhood was not the best one, this for starters, and then the communication with the host was awful...Plus, when we left the room we have and extra charge of 50€ for no reason. And the response to that from the host was: Contact Air B&B..this is not my problem basically....lame....just lame..."
-1,"I definitely would not recommend renting this Airbnb.  Ruben, “the host” never showed up to the check-in, even though he was the only person I communicated while booking and confirming the reservation.  Never once did he mention he would be having his proxy,  a sleazy, rude, Con-artist named Marco hosting the check-in.   When I arrived to check-in,  Marco made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  So uncomfortable, I made reservations for my entire trip elsewhere.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but beware of this scam Airbnb!!!  He will attempt to cancel your reservation last minute or tell you it’s no longer available after a confirmation."
-1,"Yeah well in general the place is ok the location is ok but for tourist it's a bit far
Nice and clean good check in
The problem is that instead of 2 bedrooms as we paid for, we found 2 mattresses (without the beds ofcourse) in the middle of the living room. The outside room stinked from glue and fresh paint in a way no one can be there for 5 minutes.
So we actually had no living room, no 2nd room, we did have back pain.
They didn't even clean the garden so you don't see the floor from all the leaves. 

In general- big disappointment, if I ever knew I'll sleep in that way I would never take this place.. I see it as scam, there is no reusable explanation, there is no excuse for what they did.. bottom line they lies, charged money as 2 bedrooms, and what we got is one small living room..

Too bad!!!"
-1,"WORST Airbnb experience ever, this place is a scam. I am going to keep it short as there was to much wrong with this place and with the host. 1. BAD COMMUNICATION, not answering phone calls, very slowly to reply or not replying at all our messages, the host is super charming and friendly in your face but doesn't care at all about your wellbeing or your time. The place wasn't ready by the time we arrived at 3pm and the host told us to wait another 2 hours, we were tired and wanted to settle in the boat. He also told us check in is normally at 3pm while the website states 1pm. It was a very FRUSTRATING CHECK-IN. 2. There was NO proper HEATING and NO HEATING at all most of the night provided in the boat and we've been told by the owner the central heating didn't work (which afterwards we found out was a lie) Its wintertime at the moment and it freezed at night, the temperature dropped INSIDE till 6 DEGREES CELCIUS and the small electrical heating unit run out of fuel at 2.30pm at night. We had to move a mattress into the living space because there wasn't any heating at all in the other rooms or bathroom. We could see our breath becoming vapour inside the boat. We couldn't reach the owner in the morning to ask for extra fuel and had to call airbnb help service again. After a long and cold we finally managed to get in touch and got extra fuel. 2 hours before our check out we find out from the host the central heating does work, so the last hour of our stay the living space was finally heated to 20 degrees. We couldn't believe the host has put us in a cold boat without proper heating while it was freezing outside, this is not responsible at all. 3. There was NO RUNNING WATER, we were told upon arrival that there wasn't running water so we wouldn't be able to use the bathroom and kitchen sink. and instead had to use not very clean shared shower and toilet outside in a little building. I came eye to eye with a DOG at night when going to the bathroom, a SCARY experience. This has been an issue that has been there for a longer time because we saw the previous guests had the same issue as it was written on a sign in the kitchen. If we had known this beforehand + that it would have been such a cold boat with no proper heating we wouldn't have stayed there and we would have booked somewhere else. 4. the TOILET was STINKING and NOT FLUSHED, there was still some water in the bath tub not sure why. 5. The kitchen cutlery and pots were DIRTY and the KITCHEN APPLIANCES DONT WORK, don't expect to use the gass fire, oven or dishwasher, these are all turned off and not working...."
-1,"BAD EXPERIENCE
THE ONLY POSITIVE THING OF THIS ACCOMODATION IS THE CENTRAL LOCATION IN TOWN.
YOU DON'T GET THE FEELING OF BEING AT HOME. 
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE STRICT RULES OF SAM Y A. EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN THE AIRBNB SITE BUT
1. IT IS NOT WRITTEN THAT THE BATHROOM IT IS SHARED WITH SAM AND HUSBAND.
(website hidden) SEEMS THAT THE RULES ARE ONLY FOR THE VISITORS AND NOT FOR THE OWNERS.
I CAN CALL OUR BAD EXPERIENCE AS BEING IN A BOARDING SCHOOL WERE YOU HAVE ONLY DUTIES TO FOLLOW.
IT DOEN'T FIT INTO THE AIM OF AIRBNB.
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WAS THE LAST MORNING WHEN TAKING A SHOWER AT 7.15 AM BEFORE LEAVING TO THE AIRPORT , SAM KNOCKED THE DOOR COMPLAINING THAT IT IS NO TIME TO TAKE A SHOWER BECAUSE EVERYBODY NEEDS THAT PLACE."
-1,It Was a really bad experience. The house it was really dirty in general and there is a hole in the kitchen with 2 RATS. DISGUSTING
1,"Imani was waiting to greet me at the apartment at check-in time, and was friendly and welcoming.  As other reviewers have said, the apartment is within easy reach of the centre, and is in a safe and quiet area, with plenty of shops nearby. My room was spacious and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay at Imani's and recommend it."
1,"Judit was a good and kindly host.She gave us flexibility with check-in and check-out. The apartment is just as you can see in the picture, very comfortable for two people! The neighborhood was very quiet. Even if the apartment was not very close to the centre,with season ticket we explored Amsterdam very easly! "
-1,Awful location for the price. Everything is far! We were not provided enough toilet paper either. Avoid!
-1,"A very very bad experience! 
We waited 2 hours and 15 minutes in the bar near the room for Bema's ""friend"" (not sure he was a friend, rather an employee). The house is full of people, at least from two different families. The room is not even separated by a door from the rest of the house. The room is cold even when the heater is on. The front door of the house was open when we arrived (so that anybody from outside can enter into the room). We felt so uncomfortable and unsafe that we went in a hotel instead. We don't recommand this room at all!!!"
1,I love this room so much!!　The location is reachable by metro in 5 mins. Andrea gives the warmest welcome during our stay. Can't wait to arrange next stay ! Highly recommended!
1,"Imani was very nice host. The room had separate entrance, what was very convenient and gave us privacy. We got towels and shower gel. The place is quiet with a park nearby and it is easy to reach with public transport. "
-1," small, unwelcoming at a start, which would be fine if not fairly overpriced. The  door on the bathroom was broken, the handle kept coming off whilst opening door, the heat was unbearable it hits you like the Sahara as you climb the last of the 150 steps up to your 4th level oven, no fan and Windows barely open, awful pillows make sleeping a nightmare, better off using your socks as a sleeping device, the ungodly smell that resonates from the bathroom makes even brushing your teeth dreadfully unpleasant, the neighbors are obviously not to thrilled about having a air bnb in the building the one man I did encounter was very unhappy at my few failed attempts to open the stiff front door, hosts were nice and informative but that's where the pleasantries stopped, area is very nice, beautiful location, too bad the room didn't get the memo . whilst searching for what animal died in the bathroom you will come face to face with the 1 meter high step into the shower, which would only be moderately dangerous if not for the washing machine 30 cm from the showers entrance, thus turning in into a death trap"
1,We had a great stay in Amsterdam at Imani's flat and I would absolutely recommend it. Great place not to far away from the city center. Thank you very much for your hospitality! :-) 
-1,"It's a very bad experience for 4 nights in Amsterdam. The room is noisy and dirty. I
have to share the small house （of course bathroom，washroom ）with other 6 people or more. It is very noisy in the night and early morning. What is fucking is that they force us changing our room only because they wanted to rent our big room to 3 people for more money. After，it is absurd to move our luggage to the original room even without our agreement. The room is not private at all because of its transparent window. The only advantage is the cheap museum card renting. However,  they withdrew the train card renting just the day before our reserve. Also, public security of their house is bad. In
a word, it is the worst experience in Europe for me and I advise you not choosing their house."
-1,"Can't say he's a bad host but I had a bad experience with airbnb overall. I was on my way to Amsterdam from Bruges. None of the trains had Wi-Fi service that day so I couldn't make a reservation in advance. Once in Amsterdam I had issues with the application. It took a very long time to process the reservation(about an hour) and just kept loading infinitely. I gave up on the app and closed it. I made a hotel reservation elsewhere and 30minutes after that the airbnb app finished processing the reservation. I immediately cancel it. 

I explained my situation to the host which he failed to understand and won't refund me because of his ""strict"" refund policy. This in no way is fair or good business practice. Airbnb on the other hand says my case does no qualifies for a refund. 

So basically I gave away $273.00 for a reservation I never enjoyed. Will never use airbnb again. I'm sure it has worked well for others but in my particular case it didn't. On another note, the profile states check in at 5:00pm. The host wouldn't be able to let me check in til almost 7pm. So yeah. Horrible experience. Had a good time at the city at least."
1,Perfect location in Amsterdam. Nice apartment with excellent view of canal
1,Enjoyed our stay here
1,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The house is superbly located in an area that’s the perfect mix of local residential, but just a stone’s throw from all the sights, great restaurants & picturesque canals. It’s very close to the nine streets & royal streets shopping areas and 5 mins walk from the Noordermarket, all of which we loved. We walked down to Museumplein in about 15-20 minutes, but the no 5 tram stops just around the corner, so it really is a super place to stay.  Quick shout out to the restaurant bassia just a 5 min walk away, and the nieuwe leliestraat cafe (pub) just a block away, which felt like our local after the first drink :)   Michelle was a great host (the generous welcome basket is a lovely touch) can’t recommend the whole experience highly enough."
1,"We had a nice time in Jessica's apartment. Everything was as expected. The apartment is located in a quiet district of Amsterdam. Supermarket, restaurants etc. are all very close. By public transport you can easily reach the city center. Jessica was very friendly and reliable. Thanks a lot for this."
-1,"first of all, the apartment has a very good location, however, there are too much problems:

1. we have disscussed with Twan that someone will wait for us in the apartment when we arrive, but nobody was there. we had to wait one hour outside, with a five months old yelling baby, in about 7 degrees and rain till we got a message from Twan to pick up the key from a bar which located 10 minutes walk from the apartment.

2. the apartment was very different from what we expected. the floor heating worked very bad (it was cold); the toilet seat was broken; no shampoo as promised; the bath stands on a kind of stage so if you taller than 1.80 m you should bend in order to have a normal shower; in the upper floor, there's no heat at all!! 
of course we discribed the problem to Twan and he promised to take care. 

3. at our 4th day, the light in the shower went off and we had a shower in the dark. 
we told Twan about the problem and only day after he sent a handy man to fix the it. at our last day!!!
then he also replaced the toilet seat.

4. the last one and the most ridiculous: Twan send us a request in AIRBNB to pay him 100 EUR more for a damage that he states we did.

the buttom line: we are very disappointed about the bad experience we had.
"
1,"Renske was a great help, even picked me up from the airport when my flight was delayed. Location was perfect, and an ideal apartment for one person or a couple looking to enjoy Amsterdam. Highly recommended!"
1,"Perfect for a couple , close To the metro or not too far from the City center if you enjoy To walk a bit , practical and comfortable place, a lot of restaurant, parks and more nearby ! 
Eveything you need at home ,even bicycles ! Go yourselves you won't regret !"
1,The room was very clean and spacy. Andrea was a perfect host. We enjoyed our stay in every way!
1,"My husband and I rented this apartment for a week.  We loved the location, very close to shops, cafes, restaurants and public transportation.  We were greeted by Anouk's father, Carl and later met Roland when he checked in to see that we were settling in acceptably.  We were unable to meet Anouk, who was busy having a baby!  :)

We found the apartment to be as expected.  It is a walkup and is the top floor apartment.  The weather was relatively hot while we were visiting, and without air conditioning or fans, the apartment could get pretty stuffy, even with all of the windows open all day and night.  

That was our only real disappointment, and that the clothes dryer was not working  during our stay.  The apartment was in pretty good shape, though certainly lived-in feeling.  Anouk and Roland have great taste and it was fun to look at their decorating aesthetic.  The neighborhood is fairly residential and was very beautiful.  The Dylan Hotel is literally right next door, which meant that guests (usually wedding party guests) were quite jolly and festive (read:  LOUD) until early morning hours on several evenings during our stay.  Overall, it was a good experience and a great way to see Amsterdam from and Amsterdammer's point of view."
1,"Wonderful apartment, in a calm, typical Amsterdam street, 5 minutes on foot to Central Station. We really had the feeling of being at home while at the same time indulging ourselves in the real Amsterdam flavours.

One note about the host:
When we arrived, Mike was here to welcome us. He informed us, however, that there had been a problem with the booking, that it overlapped with the one of the guests already in the apartment ... so that we could only move in the next day in the apartment. We were pretty upset, but Mike was very calm and accomodating: they offered to find us a hotel in the area, or to move us to another similar apartment. We picked the later one, and they paid for the cab that took us there, the cab that drove us back the next day, AND paid us back the 1st night, as compensation for the trouble.
Although we were quite disappointed and lost quite some time moving from one apartment to the other (the other one was also not at all the same standard as this one ...), we were very impressed by the professionalism, the responsiveness and the friendliness of Mike.

So overall a wonderful experience, of which we retain the souvenir of an amazing apartment and ... an unexpected adventure ;)"
1,"Had a fantastic stay at Erwin's place. He gave us some amazing tips of places to eat and activities to do over the weekend. Was extremely welcoming and very understanding about our awful delayed flight, even gave us a lovely bottle of wine as a welcome present! Cant recommend him highly enough. The flat was lovely and clean, in a great location, only 3 stops to the centre of town, took 10mins max! "
1,"Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Marielle who offered to help us with our luggage. The apartment was bright, clean, airy and warm (which was perfect seeing as it was awfully chilly out). Marielle provided us with with her own written handbook of the city which made it very easy to choose restaurants. She was happy to answer any questions and also sent us useful information about getting to and from the airport. The apartment is in a fantastic location, everything is pretty much within a 20min walk so we found no need to use public transport or taxis. Overall a very good experience and I would stay here again."
1,"This was a great find and in a great location! The unit was extremely clean and modern as described! There are plenty of walking distance restaurants, coffee shops, museums, red light district, historical monuments and of course the Damrak!

One side note is that the stairwell has extremely steep steps from the street level to the apartment and the railing in the stairwell was (URL HIDDEN) was loose and not attached to the wall which could present a dangerous hazard; not recommended for elderly, children handicap and pregnant women. Luggage will take time to bring up and down from the unit. "
-1,"we booked this place months in advance, 6 days before our arrival we were asked to check in later than we had agreed upon it was not what we wanted to do but we were kind of left with little choice being 6 days away so we said ok, Catalina gave us $50 refund which was nice but totaly not worth the stay.  we arrived to find construction all over the place and were given no notice of that and there was sand everhwhere that we tracked in from the construction, we dropped our bags and asked catalina's mom (whom was staying there) when we should return and she said 11am.  we went back at 11 and she left 2 hours later.  the place had mothballs under the beds, grind on the stove, really just dirt all over. on our second day we woke and could not get the stove to work, not a big deal so we went to get coffee elswhere then we went to  (ann frank, van Gogh and heiniken tour) a full day.  we got back home to find a worker who told us the gas was shut off, and later we discovered it affected the water and had no hot water to shower, we emailed catalina right away.  she had replied to every email i sent before that within a couple hours but this time she got back to me long after we had already left amsterdam the next day. turns out a simple reset button needed to be hit and the water would be turned back on but we were not given that info, instead we were insulted and told we were dirty  and we were unreasonable because we asked for more $ since we could not shower.   really bad communication if there is a problem you will not get a reply, had she replied with how to rest the water we could have showered and we never would have asked for anything else.  also i would add that we did leave dirty dishes in the sink but exuse me if i cant clean myself  why would i worry about 3 dishes?  avoid this place if you bring a woman with you as the bathroom is nasty, and you can find better places with equally good locations.  Catallina seems to be a bit unexperienced when dealing with problems and people. i would highly recommend staying anywhere else..because she compensated us for an Inconvenience at the beginng she felf she owed us nothing else for this major invoncienince of not being able to shower, not even an appology...i will be returning to Amsterdam its a great town but this place was awful and the way we were treated by the host is really unfortunate for her.  we accomodated this host more than she accomodated us and that's rediculous"
1,"Excellent apartment and host! Commicated with the cleaner which allowed us to check in early. Stayed on a Thursday and Friday night and despite the central location noise was not an issue. 
Only downside was that the apartment does get very warm despite a powerful fan being provided (it was 27 degrees each day) but we'd definitely stay again."
1,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and conveniently located to access everything we desired. The neighborhood was quiet and clean. There was good restaurants near by (my fav was Jan 19 for breakfast.) It was a lovely experience and I highly recommend Koen's apartment.
"
1,"Great area, top floor...  Would stay again.
"
-1,"I was very clear and specific when I asked if parking was included when I initially messaged Eva. She replied yes but upon our arrival told us we could leave the money for the parking on the table as we left- and not only that but the parking in question wasn't even available. This is a clear violation of terms of service and felt like a travel scam to us. Parking in Amsterdam, especially this area, is a nightmare and so this caused numerous issues and was incredibly expensive. Poor communication, or even worse, purposefully misleading. I would never book any listing with these hosts because of this alone but otherwise the room was fine. The location was directly in the middle of the famous Red Light District and that was quite an experience."
-1,"Very bad experience . Photos does not show reality,it is suitable for couple. Stairs are awful to maintain ur lugged. The market start so early with noise. Standard of cleanness was so low. Price toward apartment is not fair, we had a mouse as guest !! An experience never to repeat . Sorry"
1,"Andrea is the best host we have ever stayed. She is so helpful with everything. And we appreciate that so much! As for the room, it was absolutely outstanding, we had thee best sleep. Is sooo clean, and everything was in place! If i ever return to Amsterdam, i will definitely stay there! Thanks for everything Andrea!!"
1,"We have nice time @ Astrid's place. Astrid is very nice and kind host. the room was clean and big enough for 2 persons and the kitchen and bathroom are just perfect !
the location was about 8 min walking from metro and metro takes 20 min. maximum time to reach city center. 
Just a perfect location to stay

1,"Great space, clear, nicely appointed room and common area, good location, overall fun concept. I did have one bad experience with a staff member but the rest of the staff was super nice."
0,No one could reach our host and we were stuck with our luggage because there was no storage anywhere . he would not allow us entry until 430 pm we arrived at 10am so the first day was awful. The fridge had a small freezer in it the stove didn't work so all our food went bad over the week very disappointing . the bathroom with the shower and bath doesn't have a door so no privacy was extremely frustrating for all of us. The location was perfect in Jordan with quiet beautiful neighbourhood safe with friendly locals. Everything was close by to walk or bike and the inside decor and design of the apt is breathtaking :)
1,"Astrid's apartment was amazing, great location, very clean and she was very helpful and communicative upon our arrival. Thank you for making our vacation in Amsterdam great!"
-1,"this room is very small, too small for two persons.  Even our two only luggages can't be opened and placed inside the room.  This room is just right close to the street and you can hear everything from the street very clearly. I am a very good sleeper, but I couldn't sleep the whole night.  And the mattress is very awful, when you lie down you will feel the hard iron wires, very uncomfortable....       "
-1,"All should be aware that this Airbnb is managed be a third party company. This review is not a commentary on the owners, who generally have a lovely apartment. We had a very disappointing experience in this Airbnb, because of the management company. The kitchenware in the apartment was moldy and dirty even though cleaning is supposed to be provided. This was the least of our issues. Due to the unpredictability of travel, we were slightly late arriving to the apartment. The management company charges a 20 euro fee for this. However, the representative was AN HOUR AND A HALF late to let us in to the apartment and STILL charged US a late fee. This is unacceptable. We emailed as soon as we knew we would be late and we're told that we wouldn't be charged and were STILL CHARGED by the representative. After paying 172 euros PER NIGHT, this is inexcusable. For the price and the ridiculous hassle of dealing with Iambnb (the managers), you are better off finding somewhere else."
1,"I could not recommend this host more! Her home is just beautiful! It is a lovely 15 minute walk from Dam Square, great location. We arrived and she had laid out waffles for us, food recommendations, tourist guide to Amsterdam and mini toiletries. The house is so clean and in a lovely area. Eveline was so helpful giving us tips on places and also helping us find the best way to get to and from the airport. I would stay again next time I return. Brilliant location and brilliant house at such a good price! "
1,All basic necessities are present. The host waited for me at the location though I was late.
0,"Wely's flat was in a good location with easy access to central station and all the touristy places around. The bedroom and living space were large. Espresso coffee and chocolate was a nice touch. The pillows were dirty and I felt itchy. The sofa had lots of stains and dirt. The shower is in the kitchen with a shower curtain and no mat, so you step into the kitchen to dry off. The toilet is really tiny with a lopsided toilet seat and a barely there sink with just a cold tap. Not good for anyone who's tall or even remotely large. No shampoo was provided. The windows are nailed in so you can't open them wide and it got hot in the night. Lastly, the check in process was a bad experience and no help was given in finding the flat even after I called. A lot of this depends on you checking the booking confirmation and the long list of rules and the house manual. I was made to feel quite stupid because I hadn't checked this and so I had to ask about a lot of things. If you book this apartment, make sure you read the manual and list of rules and take snaps of them. If you don't have Internet on your phone, you won't be able to check your booking confirmation and get the wifi password. "
-1,"This apartment is in a perfect location, however the apartment it self isn't up to the standards of photos shown! The apartment is smaller in person! It wasn't very clean! There were building works going on in the next apartment from 6am in the morning! The windows don't open! There was an awful musty odor every time you walked through the front door! Including the sofa bed! We didn't eat in the apartment but still managed to find crumbles left on the floor from previous users! Cleaner did an awful job! We had no proper welcoming pack and spend 2 days trying to figure out how to work the TV which should have been made easier! Every time we contacted the Iam BNB company they would always read messages and take ages to come back to us, sometimes. It even coming back at all! We had to just turn up at the office one day to make a face to face complaint! When you're away on a break you don't want to have to deal with all of the headache that we dealt with! We live in London and lead very busy lives and wanted our trip to run smoothly and it didn't, it just felt like a job!"
1,Location and apartment were great! Stairs aren't as bad as they first seem since you are in Amsterdam after all and would definitely stay there again! No complaints whatsoever 
1,Maceo was a great host with a wonderful apartment which was perfect for strolling the streets of amsterdam. 
-1,"Really bad experience.
1st electric kitchen never worked.
2nd room very cold and when we ask about it to owner. Just say check it. Or turn it hotter. Never whent to check if problem was fixed. (Or at least a text msn)
3rd bed makes allot of noise.just if you seat. Its amaizing seems its going to break.

Amsterdam was amaizing. But if you can stay away of this place. Much better. Look for something closer to town.

And just at the departure had chance to meet the owner. But of curse. When we where leaving and for 2 seconds. I been traveling for all Europe now for almost a month and always with airbnb. And this was terrible experience."
0,"The host made us very welcome, just a little disappointed about not being offered tea or coffee on arrival and the hosts saying that they had run out of coffee. No breakfast offered in the morning and the hosts not getting up or even offering tea or coffee. The room was nice and bed comfortable. Parking was excellent and just a short tram ride to the city centre. Found it quite easy to get about on the tram. Would recommend Lita's accommodation. My only concern would be that they shouldn't advertise breakfast if there not able to provide it, therefore should lower the cost. I would also suggest keeping the kitchen clean and free from washing up is guests wish to use it, as a little off putting.  "
1,"We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam.
The apartment is very nice and tastefully decorated 
The bed is large and very comfortable.
In the kitchen you will find everything you need.
Everything is beautifully clean and well maintained.
In 20 minutes you will be in the city center with the metro and for daily shopping, there are shops and a supermarket around the corner.
We didn`t met Anna personally, but her boyfriend has passed us around the apartment and was very, very friendly and communication was excellent.
We can only recommend this apartment and thank you very much."
1,"We stayed at Emil's place for a night after we went to a concert in the Heineken Music Hall. His place is comfortably located on walking distance from the Bijlmer/ArenA train station and concert venues. The room was simple, but clean and comfortable. Emil proved to be a very friendly guy, he even drove us to the concert with his car. Thanks Emil!"
-1,"My room was literally filthy, all kind of litter under my bad: cigarette and joint butts, dirty panties and tons of dust. The listing even included a 35 euros cleaning fee: the host just takes the money and neglects cleaning completely.
The listing was marked as non smoking, but both sisters did smoke inside the house, making the environment smelly and the air almost ubreatheable at night.
On top of this, one of the sisters made loud noises and played music until late at night. I didn't feel respected at all.
In addition, the check-in and communication with the host was sloppy and some of the mentioned amenities were not even provided: never had a clean towel or soap!
I am an usual Airbnb traveler, had many kind of experiences, most of them extremely positive. Unfortunately this was not the case at all, it has been really awful and frustrating.
Plenty of money for a terrible experience, never again!"
-1,"I stayed here with my mom and my sister in August. And our stay was disappointing. I use air B and B quite a lot and I must say this is the worst one. 
    First of all, Fiona was never present. Instead a Turkish girl was there to greet us. Although she was friendly, we were not expecting her. 
    The apartment is shared with her. We had our own room and bathroom. The shower and living room was shared. However, we did not have a lock on our door. That was ok at first, but then we noticed that a man was creeping in the apartment, sleeping in her room. We had no idea who the man was, nor was he ever introduced to us. No forewarning out of common curtesy. This was very unsettling for us, since we were all women without a lock on the door. 
    My mom confronted the Turkish girl about our worry for safety, hoping to receive an apology. Instead, the Turkish girl said that she can bring whomever she wanted. We clarified by saying that, although that's understandable, there should be a lock on our door if you are expecting other guests. She finally promised to put a lock on our door ""today or at the latest tomorrow"". No lock was ever placed on our door. 
As funny as it sounds, we slept with our suit cases barricading the door and purses under pillows. 
So if you want to have random guests over who will have zero liability with air B and B, at least put a lock on the door. 
    As for the neighborhood, it's very very noisy (worsened by a window that wouldn't close shut) Although we didn't mind that at first, it definitely became the cherry on top of our bad experience at this air BnB. "
-1,"Avoid like the plague. Scam artist at work here. Unless airbnb helps resolve its probably turned me off airbnb too. 

1 day before my trip he asked for more money (100 euro) in cash. I agreed since i didn't have any other option. 

Once there we didn't like the place (not very clean, small, his damp clothes on a drying rack in the living room and  the bed is in loft with 3 ft headroom). 

so we agreed that we would stay there for a night and he will cancel the reservation for 80 euro.  I paid him and he then refused to cancel. 

All in all we left the next day regardless. Terrible terrible experience. Feels like I got scammed. 


"
1,"I've had great, good, and bad experiences with rentals on airbnb.  My stay at Angelique's was beyond great.  I chose the rental because friends who'd visited Amsterdam told me it was the most centrally located of the rentals I was considering, and they were absolutely right.  I was able to walk everywhere.  I think I only took the tram once, which stops 2 blocks from the apartment, on a return trip from Oosterpark.  

The apartment itself is huge.  The bathroom alone rivals most living rooms in square footage.  Wireless was incredibly fast -- I was able to quickly download movies from itunes, for example, which I haven't been able to do in other rentals.  

But beyond the location, Angelique was fantastic.  She was 100% responsive from the start, insanely helpful in introducing me to Amsterdam and just is an incredibly thoughtful person (as an example, she had purchased bread, fruit, cheese and milk preceding my arrival; shortly after this I told her I'm unfortunately allergic to milk proteins; the next afternoon after she'd stopped by the rental to leave some fresh flowers, I also found a fresh carton of coconut milk yogurt in the fridge).  Separately I will note that what I also appreciated is she is in no way invasive -- sometimes you can get a very responsive landlord, but their responsiveness is a little needy and crosses the border into over-involvement.  Angelique is there if/when you need her, but happily has her own life and leaves you alone otherwise.  In sum, perfect location, perfect host.  It's a little pricier than some rentals, but worth it in spades.  If you're considering a place to stay, and you're lucky enough to stumble upon this one, book it."
-1,"Absolutely awful experience. Horrendous smell in the apartment coming from the shower room, dead mosquitos/ blood splattered on the bedroom walls, dirty floors (definitely can't be bare foot!) I have been massively conned and I've learnt from this for future bookings."
-1,"We arrived to the property at our first day at 20:00, the host's boyfriend met us, welcomed us in the apartment and explained everything to us.
We we're surprised that the bathroom is shared with another apartment accupied with perminent tenants and it is completly outside the apartment on the floor's hallway, but it was our misunderstanding of the ad. Their we're no shampoo or soap for showering in the apartment altough they are mentioned in the list of amnesties.
There we're no iron, no hair dryer. We asked if we get shampoo and soap and got answered that if we need it she will go and buy for us tommorow, considering the fact that we just got of the flight and wanted to shower normally we had to buy everything for ourselves.
Because we shared the bathromm a lot of times the floor was filled with water after someone showering or the floor was dirty.
When we checked out the apartment I got a very mean and agrresive message from the host that we left the apartment in an awful condition and we are awful guest, even though we left the apartment in good condition, nothing broken or harmed, clean, just not tidy (we didnt folded the sheets or stuf like that), but they didnt asked us to. We pay cleaning fee in the payment for exactly that. But the host didn't want to hear us and left us a feedback full of lies as same as the massage.
We we're 3 quiet girls, and this is not our first stay ar Airbnb apartment and it was the first time we been through such awful and 
insulting experience. 
unless you want your vacation ruined, I would sincerely recommend staying somewhere else."
-1,"We arrived with two extra guest who joined our trip at the last minute. We were willing to pay the extra charge and we told the host who let us in. He told us not to worry about it because the smell in the restroom was terrible. And we didn't ask for any more linens to be provided. 

When we walked into the apartment, the smell from the bathroom was overpowering. It is not a big place. We open the bathroom door and shut it immediately. We were not able to use the shower the entirety of our stay. When I say it was unbearable, I am not exaggerating. The smell was AWFUL! The worst part is that I received a charge for what in my opinion was high for two extra people, but the host was not willing to negotiate a lower fare despite the smell/state of the bathroom. 

I paid my part because I believe in doing what is right and fair. The host did not feel the same and did not offer to refund us anything. After my stay, I would not recommend staying here. Which is unfortunate because the location is great."
1,"Awesome apartment, great location, would recommend to anyone"
-1,"When I arrived in AMS, host didn’t respond me any instruction how to get in the house. I called him for several times, finally I reached him when I was in his house. I think it was very bad experience for this situation. The house location is nearby the city of AMS but the bathroom is not clean and small. The sound-proofing insulation is very bad. I could hear the noise from  upper floor. I think I will never choose Ramon again even I visit AMS next time."
1,"Viola was incredibly lovely and helpful, and was happy to welcome us later than expected. The flat is clean and spacious and has everything you need. The area is a little quiet and you need to venture further into the centre to find more bars and restaurants but we walked everywhere, even in the rain! The city is so beautiful! Recommend Bar Spek for breakfast! Thanks Viola "
1,"We had a very nice stay at Kris's place. The house is very comfortable in a quiet area - and just in front of a nice park. A good choice for families with kids although I would not recommend with very young children because of the stairs and shower only. Easy access to Central Station by bus - day pass available at nearby shops - and very easy car parking in the street (and free of charge). Great welcome from Kris and Cynthia who provided us good recommendation for visits, walks and directions for supermarkets."
0,"We are using Airbnb for a few years now and had our first negative experience in the Art Deco Apt. First of all, this place is rented out by a third party called BookingHomie, try to avoid them, they are very penalty happy eg you have to pay EUR 25,- as late arrival fee if you arrive after 18h, secondly, the bed sheets were not fresh so we had to sleep in bed sheets used by the previous guests, 3rd, we only got one key that we unfortunately lost, there was no extra key, also the owner didn't have one, so the last day we had to arrange a return time with the neighbours to get back into the house again. 4th, BookingHomie proposed to keep the EUR 200 deposit, to organize a replacement for the coded key and send us back the remaining money (how they were going to do this, I dont know), after tough negotiation, we settled on EUR 40 for the key and I got EUR 160 deposit back - as I said, service wise this was a bad experience, though the place is lovely and the location close to the city centre."
1,"Good location, very clean and helpful full advice given from Kelvin’s Mother. "
-1,"Overall it was a really terrible experience and I would avoid this place at all costs. I'm sure the actual owner of the apartment is lovely but the management company that handles it ""Iambnb"" is god awful and is making me reconsider using Airbnb at all. I landed later in the evening (9pm) and was told to bring 20 euros to pay in cash to the management company rep who would let me in because of ""late check in."" This is completely against Airbnb's rules and insane. I chalked it up to a minor cost for a nice trip in Amsterdam. I then arrived and the management company rep was 30 minutes late for our pre arrived arrival time. I'm in a foreign place with no real knowledge of the area sitting outside with all of my luggage, exhausted and thankful I'm a larger man so the shady characters walking by know better than to mess with me or my things. When the rep arrives (1030pm) she lets me into the place and the place has not been fully cleaned and there are no sheets on the bed with none in the entire apartment. The kind of oversight no normal host would have allowed. She apologizes and is really lovely but her bosses (on the phone with her) implore her she still needs to charge me 20 euros for late check in (WTF). Luckily I had a friend nearby so I dropped my things and left to stay at her place for the evening, with the understanding they'd bring sheets at some point that night. They brought the sheets and I learned (the hard way) that the actual sheets were moldy and still in the washer (which was the smell I was trying to track down). "
1,"Andrea is a friendly, considerate, helpful hostess. A good room in green, suburban surroundings, as an alternative to the city bustle. Some noise at night from people coming in an out of the building. Easy metro connection to downtown. A peaceful neighborhood with several ethnic groups. "
1,Andrea was very welcoming and a thoughtful hostess! My son and I enjoyed staying at her home very much. It was clean and quiet and close to the metro station. Thank you so much Andrea!
1,"Errol was a great host, got me checked-in easily and was available for any questions.

The place is a great budget option, it wasn't the cleanest place but nothing awful and the layout of the apartment is quirky.

The double bed was a bit wonky when I stayed. Felt like two small mattresses with a gap between it that was filled with pillows or padding, not very comfortable."
-1,"We met Taco  at the boat.  Although we were told the pull out couch was made up it was not.  This was  a bit of a disappointment.  Over all not  too bad,  the Wifi rarely worked,  seems the signal from the café was not strong enough.  Would not rent this boat again."
1,"The flat is beutifully furnished, very cosy and spotless. The kitchen is well equipped. As we both love the Pijp the location could not have been better. There are an awful lot of bars, restaurents and coffee places just around the corner.
We arrived a little bit late, but Marlou was very kind and managed to accomodate our late night check-in. She also provided us with an A'dam guide and with personal restaurent and bar suggestions.
I warmly recommend this place.
Thank you very much, Marlou for having us."
1,"The situation of the apartment is perfect if you travel by car. Public transport to the center is not far and Kevin was very helpfull. He even took us once by his own boat, a great experience!
The apartment is really very special and we and our kids loved to stay there. We will come back, if we stay again in Amsterdam!"
1,"Great location only minute from bus stop to central. A minute to laundromat, supermarket, pharmacy and eateries. Imani answered emails quickly and her girls weren't an issue. Room is spacious and tidy. It is very light though and it was hard to get to sleep."
1,Cozy home housing near the center.
-1,"Hey everyone, me and my girlfriend went to the apartment of Ulrich wich we booked week before we arrived, as we went inside we saw it wasn't for us, it's far from the center and not private as we thought. We had to pay for all the nights although we didn't stay even 1. The maneger of the room was in England (?!) And there was no one to talk to. The bathroom is shared and it's not allow to smoke or even talk outside the building becouse the nibers don't like it. And last thing , check in is avillable only at 13:00. I felt like a victem of some cheap scam.
A bad experience indeed 
. Not recommended."
-1,"Good location. Nice neighbourhood. Anna was friendly and helpful and Biscuit the cat was a great host. I was very disappointed to be told at 10.30pm on my first night that this was too late for me to take a bath as it would disturb the neighbours! I arrived around 7pm and I wish that this had been explained beforehand. I stayed three nights and similarly on my final night, I met a friend for dinner and some drinks, got soaked in the rain walking back to the apartment and would have loved nothing more than a warm bath before bedtime but as I had been told this could disturb the neighbour's, I did not want to upset the host, so I was very cold in bed and didn't sleep great as a result. The beautiful bathtub was the main reason I booked this Airbnb so this was a very disappointing experience. However Anna was kind and offered me tea and a sandwich upon arrival, was happy to help me with directions and offered me an umbrella. She also allowed me check out at the later time of 12noon when I told her I had not slept well which I appreciated. "
1,"Very nice house, exactly as described. The neighboured is very quiet and pleasant for kids. Thanks for the welcome bottle of wine. I strongly recommend!"
1,"I highly recommend this apartment as it is not only a great apartment but the host is a gem of a guy. This apartment exceeded my expectations and I will definitely stay here again if I were to stop by Amsterdam. 

Location:
The location is fantastic. It is only a 5-10 minute walk from the apartment to the Centraal station. It is also walking distance from many attractions - House of Anne Frank, Canal Tours etc. 

There is a beautiful cafe around the corner called Greenwood cafe. A must try! 

The Apartment:
Chris has stocked up the apartment with everything you will need - a city map, travel guide books, towels, tea, coffee, toiletries, etc. It is clean, warm, cosy and beautifully decorated - perfect for 2 people! 

 Host:
Christ was a fantastic host! He gave us great recommendations on where to go, what to eat, etc. The usual check out time was 11am but our flight was at 6pm. He helped us make arrangements wth his neighbour so we could store our luggage at his shop and explore the city up to 5pm. We were realy fortunate that Chris was so helpful. 

Price:
At 130 euros a night, I would say this apartment is quite reasonable. I actually compared it to a number of hotels and the ones that were cheaper were awful and others were much too expensive. I was initially torn between the Doubletree and this apartment but I'm glad I chose to stay here in the end because Chris was very accomodating and helped us find a place to keep our luggage giving us another 6 hours of fun in Amsterdam!

-1,"Under the steps of the bathroom is the bed,There is no hot water in the sink,the room is cold and humid, and the skylights are glaring and unable to sleep during the day.Very bad experience, ruined my travels"
0,"Met with Jan who showed us in to our new home. Its small and feels cosy but beware of spiders.  We found them everywhere!  We used the bikes (ladies one is slightly wobbly) to cycle over to the super market.  The food there is gorgeous but it is slightly expensive.  There isn't really an other little shop nearby though which was an inconvenience for us as we were trying to do the trip on a budget. The houseboat is outside the centre but its really easy to find on the tram then the 10 min walk is quite scenic after a long day in Amsterdam.  

Its absolutely gorgeous to sit out at night and watch the sun go down. We did it every night before heading in to town. 

The reason we came to Amsterdam was to see The Libertines at the Heineken Music Hall. Really easy to get to. Tram 10mins to the centre  then on to a train at the station for about 20mins. 

Its a nice quiet location but we were slightly disappointed by the size of the boat.  This is definitely not luxury and i think slightly more like a camping experience so would not recommend to older people or disabled. 

All in all, we fell in love with Amsterdam and the area of the location."
1,"We just came back from a fabulous weekend. Thanks Marcel for your stunning apartment. The location is ideal in the centre of Amsterdam overlooking the canal. It was perfectly located next to excellent quaint shopping streets and 10 minutes walk from Dam square. 

The apartment is very spacious and warm which was perfect as we have 2 girls. The kitchen was spotless and very modern with everything needed for a family.  The weather was pretty awful so we couldn't enjoy the beautiful decking.

Marcel was very accommodating to us as our flight arrived very early so we were able to check in early. Much appreciated.

Highly recommended!"
1,"Very chic and clean. Can easily walk around the city from the apartment. Some touristy things are a little far but not an awful walk and it's really close to the Heineken Experience. It's perfect if you want to be central and near the canals but also don't want to be in the middle of noisy, busy areas."
1,"Emil is a fantastic host. The room and other areas in the house are well-equipped, comfortable and clean. Even breakfast was provided. The neighbourhood is fine and the ArenA area (train/metro/bus station and shops) is nearby, 5~10 minutes by bus or 15 minutes walking. Would definitely recommend this room!"
1,"Amazing location and lovely quiet street. 

Good flat for a short trip to Amsterdam. Thanks! "
1,"Great spot! Really comfortable and attractive space. Didn't get to use the roof deck due to awful weather, but can imagine it would be awesome if it were nicer out. Huge windows make the space airy and bright. 
The kitchen has everything you would need, and there's a washer and dryer, which was really convenient. Only one of the two shower heads got any hot water, so I'd check on that if it's important to you. The one that worked was great, though. Also, there were only two towels and no soap for the shower or toilet (separate room). If visiting in the colder months, consider bringing slippers as the floor are cold wood and tile.
The location is five stars as long as you're ok being a 30-40 minute walk to the center. Tram stops are nearby, though. And you could rent a bike, which is definitely the most efficient way to get around. The neighborhood itself is upscale and a pleasant alternative to the center with good grocery options within 10 minutes walking, and some bar, shopping, restaurant options within 10-20 minutes walking. Close to the museums, too.
All in all a fantastic place to stay. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the management company, while very friendly and polite, could attend to some details and match the services they provide to the quality of the apartment they're renting out. But I'd stay there again, for sure. Thank you!"
1,"Julia’s place was exactly what we were looking for in Amsterdam. We’d heard from a friend that de Pijp was a bit cooler than the more central areas of Amsterdam and it’s absolutely true. Every restaurant (especially Julia’s recommendations) we popped into in the area was delicious and the neighborhood wasn’t too touristy. 

But even beyond the neighborhood, Julia’s place was spotlessly clean. My boyfriend has an awful cat allergy but she cleans the place so spotlessly that we didn’t even know she had a cat until she mentioned it the last day. It’s bright, sunny, and really comfortable to hang out in. The bed is big and super comfy, especially after a day of walking around. 

Julia was really easy to communicate with and was flexible and helpful with check in and check out. We had a great stay and would definitely come back."
-1,"very good location, and very close to the Tram Station, Geert and his wife were polite, but not very informative... we choose the place because of the pictures and description, unfortunately the place was unkempt  like nobody live there for a while, kitchen/bathroom extremely dirty, the refrigerator and the microwave  with old food on it, no essentials, the bed the linen was not change from previous  visitors, In general the place needs a good housekeeping ... very bad experience from Airbnb host....  we felt "
1,We stayed here 2 days in April. Eveline's apartment is really beautifully furnished and has everything you need for your stay. The weather was awful so it was a nice place to hide out while we were waiting for the rain to stop! The apartment is about 30 mins walking to the centre or 10 mins by tram or taxi. There are small shops less 2 mins walk away and some really nice little restaurants as well. I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Amsterdam :-) 
1,"Pretty spontaneous we found this room near Amsterdam and fixed our trip just one day before our arrival. It was no problem that we arrived late due to many traffic jams on the road. We felt very welcomed by Iosif, his girlfriend and roommate. All three are really nice and open people. With an Amsterdam map offered by them and advices what we should visit in Amserdam city we were perfect prepared for our sightseeing. It was no problem to use the kitchen to prepare a dinner. The room was comfortable and the shower is just amazing! We had a key to exit and enter the house whenever we wanted. As a breakfast we tried some handmade Sushi by Iosifs roommate - what a start of a day! Iosif accompanied us to the nearby Metro station to get to Amsterdam downtown. As they had new guests arriving we cleaned up the room before leaving to Amsterdam but it was possible to leave our stuff to pick it up later. If one is traveling to Amsterdam by car it's a perfect place to stay! We thank you again for a great stay at your place! "
0,"Amsterdam is definitely a bike-friendly city so their place was perfect location for us since we rode around everywhere. 

They honored pet-friendly accommodation with no hesitation. 

The place is a cute and cozy spot for you if you are single or a couple, we found it was just enough for the both of us to get around with all of our luggage. 

Speaking of which, please be mindful that this is Amsterdam and their building is a walk up. You'll be going up steep and narrow stairs up 4 flights. 

Might not be for you if you are disabled or have less mobility. 
Thankfully Dimi (the housekeeper) helped us bring up our suitcases but it was quite a sweat for us. 

Otherwise, the place was smaller than it seems but it worked for just a few days. There will be an awful smell coming from the restroom though and I think that has to do with the pipe system. 

There is an expectation of prompt checkout and the owner will remind you a couple times during your trip so be out of there promptly.

0,"We choose Willemijn's apartment for our first stay in Amsterdam because it has three bedrooms and look comfortable enough for family with two teenagers. Our host is young lady who was very friendly to us. Although it seems that the location in Ijburg is far from center, it took us only 25 minutes from door-to-Amsterdam Central. Tram No. 26 is there every 5 minutes, but sometimes there are buses instead of trams, so you better read notifications at stations. The beach is around the corner, there is well supplied supermarket called Deen across the street, bakery and fast food is also at one-minute walk and neighborhood is very quiet and safe.
It was obvious that Willemijn's family lived there till recently because you have more things in apartment then you need for tourist visit. Maybe the only thing that was missing is hair dryer.  Beds were comfortable, wi-fi works perfect, hot water is permanent and it's was very worm inside during awful, windy and cold weather conditions for late April. 
If you expect flexible check-in because of early arrival in Amsterdam, you will be disappointed. There is strict 3pm check-in policy, no matter if someone was at the apartment before you, or not."
1,Robert is truly the best host you can ask for. The studios location is just perfect. Also you might be spoiled by some surprise flowers if you go there during tulip season. Thank you Robert and Anke!
1,"The are very friendly. The apartment is well located, you can take the bus to the center next to the apartment and it just take 15 minutes. The room is comfoirtable and big. There are some supermarket where you can shoping cheap food. It as nice to stay in this apartment."
0,"The apartment feels airy and spacious, in a great area near shop, restaurants and transport. Nice deck that catches the sunshine. Stairs are steep, not uncommon as I understand it. Bedroom blinds/curtains admit quite a lot of light even with a full moon. 

Most problematic area was the agency managing the apartment whilst the hosts were away. None of the staff we spoke to had much information about the place. Reception staff on checkin disinterested. Kim the individual at the agency who was our contact person was avoidant of responding to emails and txts. Some problems with the wifi took days to resolve because of this. Phone calls to the agency itself often went unanswered or I was cut off. A simple contact with the owner to find out the details of the wifi, early on would have saved an awful lot of time.

My overall rating of this unit and the experience there would have been higher if not for the agency managing the apartment."
-1,"We liked the neigbourhood and the fact that you are near to the centre but still in a quiet area. Although the apartment was nice (great shower), we were a bit disappointed in our room, because it was quite small for two persons. You basically just had your bed and a little space to put your luggage but that's all. And that's fine if there is a living room where you also can sit, but there was only the kitchen which was not exactly that cosy to sit in the evening, and the real living room was not to share. For 65 eur/night I would expect a bit more space."
0,"This accommodation was only OK in my opinion.  It looked and felt like the owners just left so we could stay. Not very well presented.  Master bed creaked incredibly so difficult to sleep.  Bed in other rooms suitable for children only yet we were 3adults.  3rd adult had to sleep diagonally to fit on the bed. 

The sofa was awful, visibly dirty with large black stains from age/use, I wouldn't stay here again. 

Location was good though and close to good transport system and a supermarket just around the corner 
"
-1,"Roger was not here to deliver me the keys.
He did not reply to my calls, saying that it is not him even if using the provided number.
The appartment was awful, it smelt very bad everywhere.
I did not have any indication for the check out
The bed had poor quality, the airbed also
the appartment was cold
Some lights were missing, it was properly cleaned
the bathroom was also awful
airbnb helped us with this issue."
1,Extremely clean and really close to Javastraat and a lot of cool bars! It may not sit right above all the bars but a block over and you are in a cool town that's up and coming and not very touristy!
-1,"Bad experience. I would recommend that you do NOT book this place. You can find much better value for your money. 
We booked this place because of all the positive reviews but the place has many things wrong with it and we had a terrible stay (maybe other people are too polite to leave bad reviews). 
The only positive about this place is the location. The things that are wrong with it include:
1. The place is much much smaller and very dark (both day and night) compared to pictures. 
2. The bathroom lacks privacy as it has no real door (it's a sliding piece of wood that is only attached at the top and is used to just block the entrance to the bathroom but one I would not consider to be a real door as you can see in from the sides and hear everything). 
3. The place has musty/moldy smell to it. I have also noticed some mold in places.
4. It's not very clean. The walls are very dirty with black and fingerprints all over. We were not sure if the sheets were clean and the towels had a bad smell to them. I slept in my clothes and put a shirt over my pillow. Also my partner has some unexplained bite marks on his body after staying there. 
5. The place is a fire hazard. My partner is a firefighter and said that the way the electronics were set up in the place pose a major fire hazard (the owners have four different electronics plugged into one plug which can cause a fire). 
It could be an okay place to stay if it was cleaner and much cheaper and the electronics were plugged properly but as the place is right now I would recommend to find somewhere else and pass on this one.

-1,"My experience at Eugene’s house wasn’t a pleasant experience, unfortunately. It is the first time I have to say bad things about someone I met on airbnb.
First, my flight was canceled and my airline put me on the 1st flight next day, at 6am. Due to those circumstances that were out of my control, I asked Eugene if he would accept to charge me only 1 night. He said « no » as he would loose money. Even though I wasn’t in a position to insist, the  way he said « no » really made me feel not taken into consideration and care.
Then, I had troubles finding his place according to his indications. He had to pick me up at the bus stop, but he seemed to be very upset with it. He explained to me as a teacher would do to a kid who would have done something wrong all the mistakes I did in following his instructions and said that if I wasn’t an artist and had a more scientific mind this wouldn’t have happened. I didn’t want to argue with him, but I can’t say I felt welcome… especially considering I had slept 2 hours the night before, my mind was not at it’s highest efficiency.
Later I asked Eugene for an extra blanket as I felt cold and he answered that his apartment is 22° and this is more than enough. Finally, after insisting, he gave me 2 blankets.
Eugene asked my plans and I said I was needing to sleep the next day in order to recover from my bad night. This didn’t prevent him from putting the television on when he woke up (around 10 am). I asked him if that would be possible to turn off television and he only said: « I’ll turn the volume down ». So I just had to wait for him to leave the flat so I could go back to sleep.
The room Eugene rents looks much smaller than it is on the picture and is quite expensive for what it is.
All in all, Eugene has turned his apartment into a hostel and tries to make as much money as he can. He rents other rooms in the apartment to other people and people seem to be only anonyme number that pay. That’s it. The apartment isn’t very clean and Eugene doesn’t want to adapt his habits to his guests. Never again for me. I do not recommend him."
1,"Nice little spot for a night in Amsterdam, near Station Sloterdijk with friendly hosts!"
-1,"WORST AirBnb experience I have ever had!!!! Our host called us 5 minutes before check-in time to tell us the apartment had flooded and we could not stay there. He sent us to another address across town. Upon arrival we found another girl was already staying there, who told us that Sammy had also canceled on her last minute and sent her there. Both parties found this extremely suspicious and illegitimate. An employee of Sammy showed up to let us in, who also didn't know about this other girl. Sammy then gave her instructions over the phone to take us to a third apartment (across town again). A second employee working for him dropped a key off on a moped and left without saying a word to us. This third residence did not have the correct amount of beds and was dirty. Multiple attempts to contact Sammy and discuss the problem were unsuccessful. We had one contact number for him, which over the course of our three day stay, was answered by 4 different people. Finally we got ahold of a woman who claimed to be his sister, and when we asked her for a discount she offered us an insulting rate. When we refused and asked for more, she said she needed to talk to her father and told us she would call us tomorrow. Knowing the rules of AirBnb and their 24 hour dispute policy, we filed a claim online explaining the inconsistency. The next day, Sammy's ""sister"" called back letting us know we could move into the place at 2pm but could not use the toilet until 7pm. This broke up our entire day of tourism, and when we finally arrived in the unit, there was absolutely no sign of any flooding damage. Our first night in our real apartment, we were awoken to sounds of a burglary in the shop under us. We woke up but assumed it was street noise and went back to bed. The next morning, we were awoken to Sammy and the downstairs shopkeeper banging on our apartment door accusing us of the robbery. Disoriented from waking up, we said we had nothing to do with it, and Sammy shut our door and left without giving us a chance to discuss with him our multiple problems. Finally, after multiple messages on back and forth on the dispute center, Sammy agreed to give us a fraction of our money back. All in all, he was incredibly unreliable, unprofessional, and an awful communicator. He did not make us feel safe or welcome, and caused us an incredible amount of stress throughout our 3 night stay. Amsterdam has left a foul taste in my mouth, and this is singlehandedly due to Sammy and his failure to properly host a residence. I would NEVER recommend someone to book through Sammy, and am extremely disappointed in how he handled the entire situation."
-1,"This was a really awful and weird experience. The hosts were unwelcoming and inappropriately contacted us all throughout the stay to remind us of the extensive (and unfair) rules they had about the house. They came to find us after check in at a bar with our friends to ask for more money, then later accused us of having those people to stay in the house, which was not the case. I have used Airbnb extensively and have never had a problem, I've always had great experiences and responses. These people made us feel like we were doing something wrong. I understand that many groups come to Amsterdam to party but we used the house respectfully, and honestly were mostly out and about. They did not communicate regarding check out and then let themselves into the house before check out time while we were all still asleep. There were notes on everything in the house outlining what could and could not be touched or used. The courtyard advertised, we were not allowed to use at all. 

Do not stay here! "
-1,"Do not rent from this man he took my money and when I wanted to shorten my stay he told me to cancel and I would receive a full refund which I have not received a single cent, there is a whole family living underneath who are extremely loud, the host is unresponsive, and the room is tiny and uncomfortable, the shower barley works and everything about this place is a scam, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT RENT HERE!"
-1,"Very bad experience.

He glued the chewing gum on the pillow, And Alexander Always Late Reply, And He said he need to work, will give us the key very late when we’re coming.
This guy is a joke, Do not try to Sleep here."
1,"Fantastic apartment, it was a godsend! We were originally staying in an awful hostel so decided to move to an airbnb for the remainder of the trip. Booked it on my phone and we were moved into the apartment within the hour! Gorgeous apartment too, with a balcony and a roof terrace. Really cosy and perfect location. Ideal place to stay for your trip away :)"
1,"Rick is a great host. Communication was perfect, he replied very fast and was always helpful to us. His apartment is very clean and has a very nice and cozy design. The bathroom, which is sometimes awful in Amsterdam, is super clean. The apartment has a small balcony which is pretty nice on sunny days. The apartment is perfect for up to 4 people and everything necessary is available and provided. Ricks place is near the central station but in a quite neighborhood. "
1,"perfect location for a trip to amsterdam, great terrace, easy communication and check-in and a lovely appartement. definitely highly recommended!"
-1,"While the apartment was nice , there were a few negative experiences that made our stay uncomfortable. First , the internet connection is shared with clearly other apartments in the building. The wireless router is not in the apt and is clearly in another apartment. You will not be able to get a reliable internet connection and it was a very bad experience trying to use the internet to get any work done. i did complain and nothing was done about it !! . The water heater failed, and we had no Hot water for 3 days. While we did complain, they failed to fix the problem and suggested we move to another apartment, that meant packing up again , moving and losing the roof which is one of the main reasons we choose the apt  . no follow-up on this was ever done and we stayed in the apt for the next 3 days and showered with cold water till we left. The construction work from the neighbors meant lots of banging throughout the work week and tons and tons of garbage at the entrance of the apartment . for what we paid, which well exceeded what you pay for a premium hotel, it wasn't worth it !!. The staircase, was extremely difficult, with over 4 flights of stairs to use. if you have a big bag and health problems, don't even bother !!"
1,Room is in very good location
-1,"Would not recommend. WiFi didn’t work, used towel left in the shower from previous guest, AWFUL communication. I’m a seasoned Airbnb user and have never experienced anything like this. Had location going for it and that’s about it."
1,"Very good location in de pjiip, with considerable bedroom and living space spread across three floors.  Stairs were indeed very steep, as advertised, but not a major issue once we got accustomed to it.  I would note that the bathrooms were exceptionally small, including the lone bathroom with a shower.  We managed,  but found it a bit tight, particularly with a family of 5 and all of us rotating for use of shower.  The lower level is also considerably dated and in need of a ""refresh"", compared to the upper two levels.  However, overall, the location was ideal, the positive features were appreciated, and the owner was very good to deal with.  "
1,"Andrea was a breath of fresh air as a host. Her apartment was spacious clean with all the amenities you can ever ask for. Apartment was as pictured and I must say 100% better than most hotels.  She was attentive to our needs and respected our private quarters. Will absolutely book (ahead of time, cos I know she will be in demand..lol) anytime I come thru Amsterdam. "
1,"My dad and I were in Amsterdam for a concert and Nick & Olga hosted us. Prior to our arrival, Nick had already been very responsive and provided us with an Amsterdam-Mini-Guide that he compiled himself. The apartment is very easy to find, located in a busy Carribean Neighborhood (as pointed out in the description) and really close to the Metro station ""Ganzenhoef"". Everything inside was tidy and clean and Olga welcomed us with a pot of tea. The room faces a street but is fairly quiet at night, so sleeping with the window open is surely possible. It takes about 25 Minutes total to go to the central station which is acceptable, although the metro service times are not too long. There are night busses that stop very close by, if your trip to the city center takes longer than expected ;) We sure loved the concert at Ziggo Dome and the Stedelijk Museum was our favorite! 
We can definitely recommend staying in Nick & Olga's flat - it has everything you need and the two of them are very kind and ready to help!
Thanks again from Klaus & Tobi!! "
1,Great spot to have the convenience of the city and have a quiet place to relax after. Judit was helpful and quick responding. Would stay here again next time.
1,"We had a great stay at Thea´s place. Even though we did not get to know her personally, her family was there to welcome us in our visit to Amsterdam. Adriana, her mum, was a kind host, caring about every detail. The room is tidy, clean and the mattress was comfortable. The house is spacious and has a beautiful garden, overlooking a channel. Downtown is a little far away, but easily reachable by bike or metro. We highly recommend it!"
1,a great place to relax in Amsterdam
-1,"The unit would be good for two friends or two couples, except for the fact that we were only provided with one set of keys. My colleague and I were in town for a business trip and had different schedules but we were told that, ""through bad experiences in the past we never give a second key."" We would have understood were this a one bedroom, but for a two bedroom it is mind boggling not to have two sets of keys. What made it worse is that we were then told, ""[I] hope you will be able to find a way to work it out."" Well, we had no choice but to work it out. But this caused us a great deal of inconvenience and I can 100% say that we would not have stayed here had we known about this in advance. 

Additionally, it is worth noting that the internet was rather slow and the bathroom is very oddly designed. The shower and a sink are in one room and the toilet is in another TINY room with a separate sink. I'm not quite 5'2'' and even I found the latter to be incredibly small.  

We were also surprised to find that there were no hangars or hooks available for our clothing. This was very strange and we wound up having to use the chairs in the living room to hold our things since it was a better option than the floor. 

The apartment is a bit outside of the normal tourist areas so I'm not entirely sure that it is in the best location for visitors, though for our work purposes at least the location worked out well."
-1,Be aware this IS NOT a private apartment. You will be sharing this place with 2-4 other people in two other bedrooms. COMPLETE scam for the price I paid.
1,"Paquito's place was a great exprience for me and for more 4 of my friends.
we have been in Amsterdam for a week, and there is no a better place to Spend your vacation than paco's place.
Paquito was really kind to us, in every question, every advice or anything else, it's my fourth time in Amsterdam and that was the best one thanks to Paquito.
We were able to use all the amenities and shared living rooms which were clean, comfortable, and with nice view to the dam square shopping street.
The apartment is very close to everything in just walking, all the party's, pubs and especially all the best shops and malls that are below the apartment.
there is no better host than Paquito, he was always available for every request, and after a few days you will feel he like a part of the family.
A recommendation that should not be missed !! Paquito do a tours with his nice boat, and i recommend you to ask him about this, we get from him a lot of intersting information about amsterdam, and it was amazing exprience for us.
Thank you very much for all paco, it was really great time, and our treat to meet a person like you, always smiling and so kind."
1,"We had a nice stay. The study is not very close to the Center but in auto is very easy. We left the car in a p+r and hence free Metro to the Center. It is cheaper and more easy. The study is very cute and comfortable. It is very light so people who have problems with it must be watchful at bedtime. Tks Judit!
"
-1,"Really disapointed. The description is not compliant with the flat. It is not a double room but a single one just separated with a shelf ! the ceiling is av 2m high ! not a single pan in the kitchen! no carpet bath. 1 single roll of toilet paper ! The flat is very well located but just above a pub. Music not stop till 1am as if you are inside the pub. Not convenient for a family with babies.
On top of that we wrote to the owner for fixing these problem: but not even a message ! We are used to use airb&b services and this is the first time we had such bad experience.
"
1,Liz is very kind and her place is really lovely. You can enjoy having breakfast or dinner with a beautiful view of channels. We have a wonderful time and highly recommend Liz's place.
-1,"Liz and her boyfriend Larry were nice. Liz answered every time really fast when we were in contact.
Though it's quite pity to say that, but we were really disappointed about this appartement. The flat was not furnished, there was nothing but two beds. And the mattress didn't even fit in the bed. We just got hooks for towels after we asked for that (but we got them really fast). So it was not comfortable at all and we were glad about the time, we did not stay in the flat.
The appartement looked as if no one lived in there before. So sad!
With us, there were four other guests (in a flat for two), we were seven people to share one bathroom!! That was a bit like putting as many peope as possible in one flat to get a lot of money. 
Furthermore, the flat was probably painted on the day we arrived, so there was bad air in our room and we couldn't even open the window because it was locked.
And at least it was so expensive! We payed 85€ per night!

The description of the surroundings could have been a bit more accurate. The flat is in a big block building. In the evening/night it is quite loud, because you hear the people talk and laugh outside in the compound. In the morning you will wake up with cockrow. 
So it's good to have some earpeaces if you want to stay there."
0,Stayed for 3 nights. Its not the city center but due to good public transport it doesn't matter. 20 minutes to city center or to RAI with metro.
0,"Our stay in Max’s apartment in the 4th floor was very good but not awesome. Don’t get me wrong, apart from the condition of the room and the cleanliness, everything else was perfect. The floor hadn’t been clean, the bathroom could be much better. Also the main entrance below the stairs was awful, dirty with promo leaflets. Also the price for such a dirty room was very high. Apart from these everything else was perfect: max always replied, helpful with what to do, the location was great and the bed was comfy."
-1,"Difficult to explain whats happens to us.

We were waiting for yvonne 2 hours downstairs,i send her several sms like she explained but apparently system didn't work because in each SMS she told us that she was coming in 15 min and finally we had been waiting for her 2 hours.
Appartment .when we arrived was not clean,I'll say dirty,after she Left us we had done The cleaning of it.

Yvonne has condonned us the cleaning tariff and also after my disappointment also another 75 euros.


I'll say that our weekend has started horribly But our Stay in this beautiful city help us to recover from The appartment.

Situation is all right and area very nice but conditions of The appartment could be better..."
-1,"STAY AWAY!!! Vee's place was being renovated and was a nightmare. I'm a superhost and I've stayed in more than a dozen Airbnbs as a guest, but I've never written a host a negative review before. What a horror show! This apt shouldn't even be listed, it's not suitable for staying. Deceptive - nothing is as promised in ad. I didn't get there until 2am (as planned), I stayed until morning and left. Airbnb gave full refund of guest charges including all fees. It hadn't had any reviews or previous guests, and I shouldn't have taken it under those circumstances. My uber drove around and around trying to find this place - it's like a huge industrial complex in the midst of construction - no main entrances to buildings, there's no road that can be driven all the way there. Finally owner had to talk to driver on phone so we can find the side door in dirt road. I arrived and was horrified. Floors in main rooms and kitchen are cement - they haven't been finished yet, just a cement subfloor. Walls are all drywall and plaster, none have been painted or even primed, and the whole apt smells of sheetrock and compound. It was awful. I took photos and sent to Airbnb, which is why they gave full refund. Got worse. As she walked me to bedroom she told me that the Queen size mattress that was prominently advertised was broken. Apparently she had an air mattress (wasn't disclosed in ad), and supposedly someone before me broke it. So I had a couch cushion, not twin size, much smaller and only a few inches thick. And it was on a wood board on the floor - so I had to sleep a few inches off the floor on hard cushion that I didn't fit in (I'm tall). The final straw was that as I entered the bedroom she told me there was no wifi - it wasn't working. She didn't understand why that was an issue for me (of course advertised as having wifi). Vee seemed to have no idea that this was all unacceptable, and not how Airbnb operates. And at no point during any of the many exchanges we had right up until the night before I arrived did she warn me of the condition of the place - that it's under renovation, that there's no bed, not even a regular twin, despite advertising queen, or mention no wifi, or provide directions or warning as to difficulty in finding. She offered excuses and blamed everything else without taking responsibility. Even though she admitted other taxis couldn't find it, she said it was their and their gps' fault. Said contractor did a bad job and she had to find a new one, and that hadn't happened yet. Listing said mattress but it was inflatable and that ""just broke and new one hasn't come yet"". Wifi was the buildings fault and she said it often happened and would..."
1,"This is a great little appartment. Right in the centre - or minefield- if you like. Appartment got all you need for a stay of 2 - 3 days. Any longer and you might find it cramped or too ""central"". Expect some noise at weekends. Use the ear plugs.  Worked fine for me. Location is perfect for exploring Amsterdam. Everything is close and within walking distance"
0,"The houseboat itself and communication with Taco were really great, a unique experience my children will always remember. 
I wish I would have read the previous reviews more carefully, because we were not told about the bicycles, which would have been SO helpful. Also when we first checked in, Helen asked that we pay 2 euro per towel, and said the Internet wasn’t available, which was a little awkward/disappointing.
Because smoking is permitted inside the boat, and in our case the previous guests smoked a lot, I would not recommend this houseboat to anyone who is especially sensitive to smoke. And like someone else mentioned, the shower is open to the kitchen, so it could be uncomfortable if you’re staying with friends (since we are a family, it didn’t matter). 
Overall, it looked just like the photos. Plenty of space and basic amenities, and it was great to be able to have some basic meals onboard instead of eating out all the time.
"
-1,"Our hosts were incredibly rude and unfair to both me and my girlfriend during our stay. When talking to Hans about stuff to do in Amsterdam the only advice we were given was the best places to get weed, mushrooms and snort a line of cacau. On our last day however, which happened to be 4/20, he quite aggressively shouted at my girlfriend because we had smoked in a coffeeshop before we came to get our bags, telling us we weren't welcome in his home and we ""weren't the right sort of people"", even after recommending smoking weed on their balcony a few days before! Hans also told us of a rave he was going to on the night we got there as we were also going to one called awakenings that night. However he then went on insult us for going to one other night club during our stay. Although we did not just spend all of our time in coffeeshops, like he assumed during his rant, I don't quite understand why it was any of his business what we got up to during our stay and how he dared to shout at us for smoking, and make assumptions on our personalities because of it, when it was the only advice he gave us when we got there .. quite the hypocrite. Once he had finished telling us what awful guests we were, he ordered us to take our bags and get out of his house, a very unpleasant end to our trip. I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere if you are planning to visit Amsterdam, which you definitely should as everyone else seemed lovely, and save being ripped off £100 a night by these unpleasant people."

1,"I enjoyed four fantastic days at Miranda and Paul's home with my 13 year-old daughter. The house is as cosy and welcoming as it appears in the photos and the village in which it is located is beautiful and an ideal destination for anyone who loves the countryside. It is also only a few kilometres away from Amsterdam, so we were able to visit different picturesque villages by bike and to spend a day looking round Amsterdam. Miranda and Paul lent us a bike for my daughter and Paul went to the trouble of accompanying us to rent one for myself at a decent price. They were both incredibly helpful, advising us which places to visit and which routes to follow. The meals were excellent and of top quality, with various foods picked from their own gardens. Miranda is a great cook. I can testify to this as, apart from the generous breakfasts served each day with freshly squeezed orange juice, we also had dinner with them a couple of evenings and enjoyed healthy and excellent dishes.    

The attention they gave us throughout our stay was extraordinary. Even though I don’t speak English very well and my daughter speaks even less, we were still able to enjoy good conversations with them thanks to their willingness and patience. And Miranda has also got a great way of connecting with young people. My daughter, who is very shy, felt very comfortable and at home with them. 
Thank you so much, Miranda and Paul, for making our stay so enjoyable and so enriching.

0,The sofa bed is not very comfortable and I would not recommend it for more than one very tired night. Overall its perfect for a single or a couple.  I had to turn the heating off as it made so much noise at night
1,"Antine was an absolutely lovely host! She age me easy to follow instructions on how to find the place, and was always available if I had any questions. She made my friend and I feel super welcome, even providing a basket containing stroopwafles and wine for us!
 
The location itself was lovely and perfectly situated in the heart of Amsterdam. The house is a refurbished garden house situated at the back lot of an old mansion that is in the process of being converted to apartments. We had access to a large garden and the area was super quite for sleeping.

The only thing future lodgers should keep in mind is that because the building is old, be prepared for the possibility of some small mishaps occurring during your stay. In our case, there was a wasp nest just above the roof and they came into the house because of the cold weather - and unfortunately I got stung while sleeping. That said, Antine dealt with the problem right away and could not have been more helpful. And I know she felt absolutely awful about the situation, which was obviously beyond her control. 

Overall if you are looking for a beautiful location in the heart of Amsterdam, then look no further. I highly recommend both Antine and her lovely garden house! "
-1,"Abnormal bad experience. This is a scam. The landlord 18:00 at the central train station to meet us. But I had made a mistake, I booked only one person, the landlord asks for 50 euros. After negotiations, we decided plus 30 euros, so the landlord drove us to the apartment, but on the way she asked the site to give her 40 euros, but she refused to give us a receipt. And attitude is very bad. Apartment conditions are very bad, she asked us to not open the window, a lot of restrictions, in her attitude has been very poor, very poor upbringing. I suggest that you do not order her room."
-1,"This was an absolute disgrace - also from Airbnb side as they could not have done any checks.  This was most probably a scam.  I was emailed by Oscar and told him what time we would be there.  All good and he said he would see us there. We were left outside the premises for 2 hours waiting to be ""checked in"" - on phoning Oscars ""friend"" said they would be there soon.  After 3 calls the phone went straight to message.  Then it was suddenly cancelled by this ""host"".  Furthermore, on inspecting the picture it was definitely not taken at this premises!  My wife had a knee operation 3 weeks earlier, so we were left high and dry and had to run around Amsterdam looking for a hotel - which we eventually found at 50% more.   Airbnb promised a refund - not much help though when we have to pay upfront for hotels. 
Totally and utterly unimpressed with my first Airbnb experience!!!  Definitely a scam."
-1,"Sven went out of his way to attempt to fix  the things I complained about and he should be commended for the effort he put into trying to please us.  He returned our cleaning fees and he gave us 100 gift card to his restaurant on first floor. Which was nice of him.  But there were multiple issues. The biggest problem was the cleanliness of the place.  We found a pair of dirty underwear stuffed between the headboard and the mattress. GROSS. we started the week with only one bath towel each. There’s no way to dry them so we needed more for the second day showers. So he got us extra towels.  Second, the comforter was too small.  Twin size comforter on queen size bed.  There were two of us.  It was eventually replaced with a queen comforter.  But not nearly as high quality as the twin down quilts we started with. Third, there was smell of smoke in the apartment every night.  Finally figured out it was coming from smoke stacks which ended at the rooftop terrace.  We didn’t smell the food cooking, but we did smell the smoke and it wasn’t pleasant. Fourth, and I blame myself for not reading the other reviews, but there are cell phone towers on the roof terrace.  So, we paid a lot of money for the place but didn’t feel comfortable hanging out there.  Besides that, someone from lower floors came up to roof deck while we were there.  Startled us and we were a bit embarrassed cause we were walking around in our underwear at the time. ( we had been promised privacy ). So, if you want a spacious place, this is a great room, but it’s not an apartment.  There is no kitchen. Which I knew about but I figured if I had the grill I would be okay.  Not true.  No grill.  And no microwave.  Even though it want advertised, it should be there so people can reheat their leftover food at least.  Be prepared to eat out a lot.  There are no cooking facilities.  Besides that, we had a great time in Amsterdam but we spent most of our time at our friends apartment instead.  Know what you’re getting and you won’t be disappointed.  Read all the other reviews too.  They tell you a lot. Anyway, I do like Sven and do believe his heart is in the right place but he wasn’t the one managing the place.  The manager is AdamSuites and they are in charge of meeting and greeting guests and cleaning the apartment. Since they didn’t do a thorough job, it reflects poorly on the host.  Sad but true.  As an Airbnb Superhost myself, I don’t delegate my reputation. I check on everything myself after the cleaning crews are done and before my guests arrive.  Sven should have done the same."
-1,"Negative!  The only bright side is that I was able to shorten a planned 7-night stay to one night, and AirBnb stepped in and refunded both their service fee and the host's cleaning fee.  They earned my respect for their handling of this on my end.   

I've used AirBnB for five years and in several countries.  This was easily the most negative experience ever...and maybe the only really negative experience I've had.  Once I'd booked, everything went south and stayed there.  In brief, I suggest you stay away from this flat and this ""host.""  

Frankly, I'm not sure how to write this review.  As with other reviewers, I doubt there is really a ""Sammy,"" or at least not an agency or group behind him.  There clearly are several properties involved, and Sammy (or whoever) has been registered since way back.  Thus, over 2,500 reviews.  But, the reviews range from glowing to awful.  All l can say is, my experience was the latter.  The single constant throughout the reviews is the use of automated responses to messages after booking.  I my case, these were detached and bordered on the surreal.  

So to summarize:  (1) After booking, I received no more authentic messages from the host; (2) I was admitted to the flat about 20 minutes late; (3) On entry, the flat had not been cleaned: unmade bed, dirt and spilled beer and food everywhere; (3) I left for several hours so the cleaner could come, but on return still found old food in the fridge, wet dishtowels in the washer, old dirty bedding stuffed under the bed and in the closet; other long-time debris under the couch; beer bottles on the deck and under the sink; and the remaining closet and bookcase in general disarray; (4) zero light fixtures, just bulbs on wires hanging from ceilings and walls; as well as a jumble of wires and cords in kitchen and behind TV/stereo; huge windows with zero curtains to block the sun; and outside the railroad track next door with trains passing every 5-10 minutes in the morning; (5) a cold, sterile and inaccessible neighborhood, split by the train track and only a couple snack shops immediately (URL HIDDEN) bars, shops or restaurants except on the other side of the station, and then not much; and finally (6) a concern about burglars, as the guy who let me warned me of leaving the windows open when I was gone because they were a risk.  "
1,"Hamaied was a great host, hospitable and provided great tips about the local area. His place was clean and comfortable and check in/out was very smooth. The whole of Amsterdam is on the doorstep of his apartment and was great for our extended weekend trip. Thanks Hamaeid!"
-1,"We were disappointed with the apartment. It was not clean. Very shabby. Rather far from not only the center but at least 20 minutes walking to the museum square. The host was very welcoming, he was waiting for us, presented a bottle of wine, was very quick to answer,... nothing to complain. But I can't recommend the place due to the sense of uncleanliness and worn look. It was a bad experience with airbnb.com as it seemed much better to book a hotel instead."
1,stayed 4 nights at the studio and it's the perfect respite after a long day of walking in the city centre. it was an easy 15minute bus ride from centraal station which was often the perfect amount of time for us to shake off the last of the sleep. judit was really lovely and accomodating up til the moment we left and really appreciated everything she and her sister did to help us feel comfortable during our stay. would definitely recommend!
0,"This flat is in a great location, has lots of natural daylight, and potential to be a perfect Airbnb listing. The hosts were friendly, accommodating and helpful which we really appreciated. 

The flat could definitely benefit from some maintenance and love to make the stay more comfortable. The kettle is broken, light bulbs need replacing, the drawer in the kitchen has fallen out and been left on top of the fridge, the sofa covers and bed valance are stained, and during our stay there was a drain problem which meant an awful smell came up from the kitchen sink. The host did kindly offer to have a plumber come by and fix it when we told them but in general our stay would have been a lot more pleasurable if the flat was given some care."
1,"Nice place not too far from the city centre. Takes about 15/20 mins on the bus which is also close to the apartment. 3 decent sized bedrooms, 1 shower and 1 separate toilet. Open plan lounge/kitchen with lots of space and majority of utensils available for use. Host was easy to contact and helpful. There is also a small garden which is nice to have to relax in. Quiet area with some local shops (walking distance). All in all ideal for the price and would come back again."
-1,"I would not recommend booking this room at all.

The address given in the description is not the real one but located about 4 km away.
The pictures from the room are also fake, I had to sleep on a mattress on the floor instead of a real bed as depicted. The sheets had some stains on them as well, as did the bathtub.

The wifi never worked (not even once) supposedly because it is a ""hidden network"", even after I added the name and WEP key for it into my phone myself.

The hosts also turned off heating in my room during the last night I spent there and will show up anytime you keep a light on for more than a minute.

You will also discover a set of rules upon arrival, some OK (do not waste food or energy), some less so (€5 bill for a bath instead of a shower, €26 cleaning fee for using perfume/shampoo/cologne).

The only positive IMO was the breakfast which was good.

This felt like a scam."
1,"Thanks to Thea's organization and her family's very kind and helpful welcome, and their very cozy home, I had a great introductory week to the Amsterdam region. Thank you."
0,"Tom was very nice and a good host. He let us come early and was very kind and we felt very comfortable. However, we did pay for 3 guest and 3 beds and only 2 of us could make it and there was only 1 bed that we had to share. The heat in the room also did not seem to be working and it was a very cold weekend. The wifi was unreliable and kept going off. Overall it was an alright experience staying with Tom. It was not a bad experience at all. "
-1,The most unfriendly host I had so far. He thinks he replies to everything perfectly. Only that he does so in his own way believing everything is simple and everyone should understand perfectly. 
-1,"DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. (Explanation follows)

The host never showed up. The weeks previous to the stay I'd been happy as I was getting tons of automated tools email, giving me instructions on how to pick up the keys, offering me transportation, asking me what time we'd arrive at the place so he could meet us there. When check-in day came we followed his instructions by messaging him at the appropriate time on Airbnb and by phone, and never got an answer.

We got to the place with no answer still on any medium, started calling and didn't get a response, finally, somebody picked up the phone when we called form a different number.

We were told that we needed to go elsewere to pick up the keys. We pointed out that it was freezing, raining, and that we had received numerous communications with check in instructions and we'd followed all of them to a t. They told us that they would ""see what they can do"", made to wait for an hour and a half, and finally told that they were not coming. We asked for the reservation to be cancelled and get our money back, they told us that they couldn't do it over the weekend but would call us to fix it on monday, obviously that never happened either.

We ended up staying at a hotel, when we called them on monday to get the reservation cancelled they told us to ""talk to airbnb"" because they didn't issue refunds. This listing is a scam, and is full of lies, you'll see a similar story by another couple in the reviews that we were unfortunate to not read.

We are in the process of reporting this to see if we can get our money back or at the very least get the listing off the site and the host banned, please don't give these scammers any more free money."
1,"Carlos was very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  A really nice guy. The apartment was lovely, warm and sunny. It had everything we needed . Great location too. I want to live there!  "
0,"Great location and very responsive host. Pictures appear to make the apartment look nicer than it really is. Had some basic issues with certain amenities, like the shower not draining which also caused an awful stench in the apartment. Very little lighting throughout the place so when the sun went down it was difficult to see. Tough to beat this location, however I'd say itself over-priced based on the quality."
1,"I had a fantastic time here at Mirjam's. The guest room has an incredibly comfortable, warm bed with a huge window overlooking the green park outside. The room is completely silent and peaceful - perfect after a long day of sightseeing and activity. In addition, Mirjam's washroom is incredibly designed. The shower is perfectly sized with great water pressure and sensitive temperature gauge to your liking. There is also a spacious bathtub to soak your feet in to make matters even better (if possible).

Mirjam was helpful, hospitable, and kind in every way, from picking up groceries for my breakfast to offering me homemade pumpkin soup at night. She allowed me to use her bike during the day, and recommended local stores for my specific shopping needs. I wholeheartedly support and recommend Mirjam's accommodations to any weary traveler who is looking for a lovely new friend in a quiet Dutch flat in the beautiful Netherlands. Thank you, Mirjam - I won't forget your kindness.

A hug from Reykjavik,
Rachel"

1,"It was a fabulous experience to stay at Thea's house. The back view of the house was amazing and Thea's mom was helping us in providing the route list to amsterdam places. unforutantely Thea was not available at house. Special thanks to Thea's mom for all the favours.

Thank You

-1,"I wouldn't be staying in this accommodation again or using this host again. The apartment itself was in bad condition, dirty and nothing like the photos suggest. It is over looked by office blocks, no privacy, the ""balcony"" is not actually in use and full of rubbish and the owners belongings.  The road outside was noisy, again no note of this on the description. It was far too over priced and we would not be coming back to this apartment or using this company again."
1,"Thank you so much Judit for your wonderful hospitality. The flat was clean ,comfortable ad very easy to find and to join by bus and car .Judit is a very kind lady and gave her best service to her guests .
I recommend this flat for any one who wants a  good an reliable service from a very kind host .
Good luck Judit and Thank you again !!

0,"The apartment could be lovely and it’s in a perfect location but the finishing touches and eye for detail and even basic comforts are lacking. The bedding was awful, very bobbly, hard and so un comfortable to sleep on. The bedroom was also very small. The neighbours above were also very noisy and woke us up at 8am every morning. The host was pleasant enough but just needs to put abit more effort in with comfort."
1,"This was my first airbnb experience and Klaas and his houseboat made it absolutely stunning!!

I can recommend Klaas and his location 100%.
The perfect experience for Amsterdam - don't miss it!

Klaas was a great host - reliable and friendly before, during and after stay.

We enjoyed this location a lot. It was wonderfull to sit at the terrace and watch the swans and having a nice glass of wine. (He had a great selection of wine for a reasonable price.)

We will come back in future for sure! ;-)"
1,"From what started with a trip from hell after being scammed, we managed to get this apartment last minute and I'm so glad we did. Far enough out the city night life for those quiet nights in, but close enough to get a tram/bike or even walk in easily to the centre. Local shops just around the corner for those breakfasts your friends promised to cook. 2 very spacious rooms with a comfy mattress for our 5th guest, and a lovely open plan kitchen/living room with a little balcony that is lovely in the sunshine. Nishit as well is a lovely chap who was warm and welcoming to us and managed with any questions or queries we had. Will definitely be staying again. "
1,"Hugo was a great host. He checked in several times before we arrived to make sure we would be ok finding his place and providing recommendations for restaurants, etc. His space is a perfect location -- central but quiet. And the design of the space is gorgeous. We were two people, and it was perfect for us."
1,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Andrea's place!
The room was awesome. Very spacious, bright, extremely clean and tastefully decorated! Andrea is super friendly and helpful - she treated us like family and made us feel right at home.
The location is convenient with a short walk to the metro station.
Highly recommended - thank you Andrea!"
0,"This apartment was in a great neighborhood and location, close to the canals in the Jordaan area, unique shops and restaurants.  The houseboats lined the canals and the homes along the canals were picturesque.  We were somewhat disappointed in the apartment however.  I worried that the next thing we touched would break and the lighting was low and awkward.  There was no bathroom sink or bedroom door and the washer and dryer were pretty bad.  It was nice having a cat though you must consider feeding him twice a day and letting him in and out.  We enjoyed our time in Amsterdam nonetheless and got used to the quirks soon enough.  Not pristine or fancy...be warned."
-1,"I wish I could have left a better review but unfortunately this trip did mean my 25th birthday was dampened.
Firstly we were told we would get a complimentary drink at the bar where we picked our key up - we were not offered anything. 

With regards to the apt, the key was awful in the lock and the door was a struggle to open! there were no welcome notes or info about the apt, it was very formal and basic. It felt impersonal. 

The apartment was lovely and clean but it really was not at all as described. The listing says it sleeps 3 and the bed is photographed at an angle to make the bed appear larger and the room brighter. Everything was very basic, none of the essentials you would expect in a hotel room, tea coffee soap etc. the bed was hard to sleep on, it felt like the cheapest furniture you could find. My friend slept on the sofa bed and she was fine, but there was a lack of bedding. The one duvet we had was very lumpy and uncomfortable so both of us resorted to sleeping under sheets. 
The main problem was the noise! I was woken up at 7am on my birthday to construction workers stamping up and down the stairs and working on flats above. It was unbearable - it triggered a migraine and I spent most of my birthday ill in bed. Migraines affect me badly to the point where I am often hospitalised - it could have been avoided if you had told us about the construction, I only had one 25th birthday. 

When we gave the key to the cleaner, he even said that you had been aware of the construction. If I had been told this, there is no way I would have stayed in your apt. the cleaner was lovely and very friendly, I feel like he was the only good part about this listing - the place was very clean and spotless, I can't fault that. I just can't believe you knew that there was loud construction works and you didn't mention it - it's really made me unhappy. If I could ask for my money back, I would, I really was disappointed. "
1,"We totally enjoyed our stay at Marijke's B&B. She was a wonderful host, we immediately felt at home. The gardenhouse is located in a very beautiful place. Everything was very clean. We highly recommend this beautiful place!"
1,We had a great time at this place! Very good location and the hosts were very responsive to our messages. Our son had a great time playing with the toys- especially the cars. Great stay and highly recommend
1,Was exactly what was pictured! Great stay 
1,"Excellent, comfortable and functional apartment.   All amenities close by including good transport links to the centre.  Is also only a short walk to the city and some of the other main attractions.

Raul who hosts the apartment is very good with his communications and was very helpful when we arrived.  We had no problems during our stay.

This place has a good sized outdoor space which is probably unusual in Amsterdam.  Basically there is a nice terrace with outdoor seating.  Not amazing views over the traditional canals but it does look over some water.

There is also a great techno nightclub about 400m walk which is great if the weather is awful and you can't face travelling any further."
-1,"Stay away! Horrible experience! Rude when corresponding, not responsive upon my actual arrival and yelling on the phone forbidding me to come to the house. I am truly shaken! I have lived in Amsterdam for seven years and wanted a few nice days for work and to catch up with friends. I am a host myself, and I am in complete shock by being treated like this.  The host has a strict cancellation fee, which means if I cancel myself I cannot get my money back. After she hung up on me I was called up by a man from an unknown number asking if I needed a place to stay and I later received two emails claiming to be support from airbnb – however the emails had a different layout and sender.  Scam or the last place you want to book for your holiday in Amsterdam."
1,"I've stayed twice at Judith's place and both times it has provided me with just the accommodation I need. It's a convenient, self-contained studio so is perfect for the traveller who wants to look after himself (or herself). Judith is very friendly and helpful. The studio is away from the city centre but easy enough to get to on the No.33 bus, or (better) by bike. It's about a 20-minute cycle from Centraal station so cycling is best for people who want a bit of fresh air and exercise. The supermarket across the street provides all the survival essentials."
1,We had a great couples weekend here. We loved the apartment and the location. 
-1,"Before arriving in Amsterdam, I was told by Frank that the key to his apartment would be at the coffee shop across the street, in an envelope with my name on it. When we arrived at the coffee shop, the staff had no key, and no knowledge of one being left for me. I tried to reach Frank several times by phone, and sent him a message over AirBnb's messaging- all without response. After an hour, I tried the alternative number under the host profile- a woman answered, who told me she would try to reach Frank. I soon received a call from Frank, who explained that the previous tenant had left the key at the wrong location. Frank was very apologetic, and offered us a bottle of wine from the fridge on him. As frustrated as we were initially, once his female friend came to drop the key off (30 min later) we were fine; that was until we got into the flat and realized that none of the bedding was changed/clean (I found men's dirty underwear in the master bed) and all of the towels were dirty- the apartment had not been cleaned at all. Again, I messaged Frank who apologized and told me that he he been told by the previous tenant that it would be left clean, but I had to wonder why Frank hadn't planned on checking up on the place in between guests to ensure that everything was in place and cleaned up? We spent the first couple hours washing and drying the linens which was honestly very frustrating. The apartment itself was nice, but after all the previous good reviews I had read about Frank's place, I was quite disappointed to find it in the state it was. I hate to write a poor review, but I hope that it prevents the next tenant from running into the same issues. "
1,"I really enjoyed staying in Lauren's family home. The benefit of the location was peace, the sound of the birds, the deck upstairs and balcony off the kitchen.  Sometimes you hear other families or neighborhood music through the walls or outside, but I liked feeling part of that culture as opposed to the awful Red Light district culture we had been in previously.  We loved the beautiful sun dappled tree view from the bedroom.  There was lots of space, great kitchen with everything we needed to cook up meals including incredibly yummy wine gifted upon arrival!  This is a family home, as opposed to an instant book hotel like place, so there are family photos, its lived in...but I liked that and it was clean and it was so nice for Laurens to say on the last day via text, don't worry about having to clean the place.
Though it was not super close to the city center, it was around an 8 7-8 mins walk to the Amstel train station and easy to catch a taxi from there.  It seemed Uber also was willing to come out to the area but it often took up to 10 minutes to get Uber.  Overall, we were more than satisfied and would go back."
-1,"This ""apartment"" is not an apartment. It is a crash pad. It might be a ""great"" location for younger folks looking for fun, but as a family with a young child, this was an awful place to stay.  Not only was it in a completely different location than we expected (Warning: If you use Goolge Maps, ""Spui"" will show you a different place than ""Spuistratt""). It is a well-worn room (all the walls are dirty), noisy street (all night), no fan, a brothel each side of the apartment, broken WiFi, broken cable. We paid an outrageous $300 a night for this room. A total rip-off. If you want to party all night and then just have a place to sleep, this place is for you.  For family - not for you.  Not worth the money."
-1,Worst experience. 
1,Great apartment - highly recommend for a weekend break. 
0,"This apartment was a nice size and we really appreciated having 2 bedrooms.  Things for future renters to keep in mind:

The apartment is at the top of several sets of very steep narrow stairs.  We were able to manage with our luggage but no one should rent this place if they struggle with stairs.  

The building and courtyard are gorgeous!

The plumbing is questionable - toilet didn't seem to ever truly flush and it took a while to figure out how to shower without being scalded.  

Bath towels are provided but there aren't any hand towels - buy papertowels or bring them with you.

This is a rental where there is minimal host support/communication.  We arrived late and ended up having to wait over an hour for our host to give us the keys even though we kept him updated via the Airbnb app and even left a voicemail.  He also did not give us any instructions on how to find our unit and it was actually kind of difficult - we had to to go through an unmarked door to find our place and in the dark, that wasn't easy.  Our host was quite apologetic about the awful check in but don't expect tangible support  - they are really only there to hand you the keys.

Overall, we appreciated having an entire apartment to ourselves instead of having to share a hotel room and transportation was extremely convenient."
1,My boyfriend and I stayed at Judit's for two nights and thought the apartment was great -- it was very easy to get to from Centraal Station and the room itself is nice and comfortable. Only small issue was that we couldn't get the wifi to work but besides that we had a lovely stay. 
-1,"I was disappointed.  I paid $250 per night and it wasn't even close to a $250 per night value.  The place definitely has a lot of character as the exposed brick and wood were very interesting, and the neighborhood has a great coffee shop, but there were a host of issues. 

First, before arrival, I never knew who I was talking to.  The listing says hosted by Lex, but then I was talking with another host, and then I was talking with ""Iambnb"" their hosting service. 

When I arrived, the place was dirty!  I had to broker permission for the cleaning lady to do things like scrub the mold off the bathroom ceiling and clean the floors.  While she took care of that and other things like the hair all over the sofa bed, the chairs were dirty and gross as were the pillows on the sofa bed.  A lot needs updating too--bedroom carpet, bathroom walls, etc.

The pictures are definitely deceiving.  It's furnished with tiny furniture to make the place look much bigger in the pictures than it really is.

I just never felt fully comfortable there the whole time I was there.  ...Other than the bed, which felt very luxuriant and comfortable!  But because the bedroom was right by the garden (which is all blocked off and inaccessible), I got a spider bite at some point one night.

I would have been happier with the place if I had paid under $140 per night.

Lastly, because checkout was earlier than I was leaving town, I left my bags at the Iambnb office.  When I went back later to pick them up, no one even noticed I was there and taking them.  The bags were there, so it was fine, it just made me feel weird that I wasn't acknowledged and someone could just come take the bags.  For a youth hostel, I might expect this.  For $250, it was disappointing.

Overall, I would not stay there again."
1,"Host was great, communication was fast and the location was spot on. How was clean and inviting. Will stay again. "
1,"Having the 3rd and 4th floor gives an apartment feel that you can relax in.  Location is walking distance from the train station and also very easy to get around town.  Although there is no A/C, there are plenty of windows that provides fresh air.  Annemieke is a wonderful, thoughtful host that is always available."
1,"One of the best locations. Very close to main attractions in a peaceful neighborhood.

The house is stylish, clean and comfortable. Much more than I expected. You feel the local experience.

Roos is so cute. She even left great tips for us in the house, and let us leave our luggage until the bus.

Higly recommended!"
-1,"The smoking rule is a big lie on arrival you will be able to go sit on your balcony and enjoy the wonderful views of the full ash tray of various brands of cigaret butts. 
There are doors that lead you to the balcony and a window behind the bed that hasn’t had the window cil dusted for months.
After forgetting about these problems and going to explore Amsterdam we returned to the property to have a shower and go to sleep, until we ran the water and it stunk like sewage. There is also no privacy in the bathroom the surrounding buildings have roof top terrace and can see straight in while you are in the bathroom.  We went down to see if we could find the owner of the property but no answer on any of the 4 floors below us. The property is not ran by the owner it is ran by an agency who on arrival was very helpful but have still not had any response from them after ringing to complain. Not allowing it to get to us we walked to my sister and brother in laws accommodation over a mile away to wash and brush our teeth.
After a long day with a lot of walking we arrived back at apartment. We got woke up by the property shaking. The kitchen cupboards banging at 7:15am I rang the number given to us and spoke to a member of the customer service team who told me he didn’t know what to do as he was the only person on shift at that time. We left the property as soon as we could after hearing and feeling the building shake for over 15mins.

After complaining to the owner via Airbnb I was offered my £35 cleaning fee as he apparently spoke to his cleaner and she forgot to clean certain places. 

Could have been a one off bad experience but would not stay again if it was free. 

Good luck hope your stay is better than mine"
0,"Stefano smokes in his apartment.  This might be really good for those who smoke, but for me it was awful.  It did not smell very bad when I arrived, but after I went out and came back again, the stench was very strong. Steffano also did not have sheets on the bed. All that said, he is a very very nice guy."
1,"There are only good words to describe Miranda, Paul and her wonderful home. They really made me and my mom feel at home, we cooked, laughed, ate together, it was a very memorable time. We had a lot in common, from cooking, vegetables growing, composting, love for the environment etc. Very hospitable, and I will definitely be back! The house is a bit out of Amsterdam, but a quaint and peaceful little village away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We enjoy the long walk home from the nearest bus stop, and cycling around the area was really a bliss. There's nothing else we can ask for, it was perfect. Thanks again for everything! "
1,Peter en Katja are nice and informative with details of restaurant nearby. My little one really likes the garden and The place is cozy we definitely will want to stay here again when we back to Amsterdam 
1,"Olga and Nick were nice and friendly hosts, it was a good communication and we got some nice tips for the city too. It's a nice room to sleep in and we would always recommend them."
-1,"The house-boat is beautiful - especially the kitchen windows being almost at eye-level with the water.  The furnishing is in good taste and there's a lovely deck to sit on to watch the boats go by.   All of these provided for a potentially good vibe. The location is not ideal,  though there were a few 'beach parties' not far away on the canal that were pretty lovely.  No A/C so it got really hot, and -  the toilet smelled - which may just be part of being a houseboat? 

Despite so, we had a few issues with our stay.   It was complicated to get the key, and the owner -  although highly responsive by email - actually was not helpful at all.  Instead he delegated the key hand-off to an incredibly rude friend, who kicked off our stay with a very bad taste.  Really pretty awful.  There were several small issues we encountered during our stay that despite lots of email contact were not really addressed, and to top it off, the owner was very 'officious' about our 11:00 AM check out time, allowing nowhere to leave your luggage    - despite it being another logistical problem.  All and all our impression was a real lack of human touch that is usually one of our preferred  highlights with Airbnb rentals.  We will not be back for those reasons.  "

-1,"DO NOT STAY HERE! We rented this place for three nights and four days. We had been on a ten hour flight so the first thing we wanted to do was take a shower. About two to three minutes into my shower I noticed the water wasn't draining and had overflowed onto the entire bathroom floor. We contacted Zander right away and left messages. He never called or messaged us back throughout our entire stay, even though we tried contacting him multiple times. On the last night we got a strange message through ""Whats App"" saying that our reservation had been cancelled and we needed to leave. The second message said we had a new reservation at some strange apartment. We told him we would only reply through air bnb and he got hostile right away. My partner and I didn't feel safe and immediately packed our things and had to find another hotel late at night even though that night was already paid for. We ended up spending more money, and were shower-less for three days after traveling overseas to another country. This was the most awful experience we've ever had."
1,"We went there for the weekend and everyday it was pouring water, absolutely awful weather. 
Even like that we still managed to go around on our bikes to the central. The location of the flat is very good, quiet, but with easy reach everywhere, and the view.. Just WOW! 
The host, Danny, very pleasant, he will give all info you need, and if needed, I'm sure he'll agree with a late check out!
I fully recommend it!!"
1,"We very much liked the stay in Celines apartment, especially the rooftop terrace and the local area around the apartment is fantastic!

Having said that, we had some minor bad experiences about the apartment. First, the bed linned and the towels were not delivered in the apartment when we arrived. Secondly there was a  bad smell in the apartment, probably coming from the kitchen on the upper floor with a dirty kitchen sink and garbage not taken out from the last stay.

All in all we liked the apartment very much. 

Best regards, Tobias and Louise."
-1,"How to describe this really bad experience?!!
Georgette propose rent on this website only to make money.
First of all, concerning our arrival, Georgette gave us meeting in front of a nice building. The adress who indicates on the airbnb.
However 245 in the street doesn't exist. We decided to call her.
She arrive 5 minutes later and she told us to take the car to go to the room without greeting us and saying hi, hello or good afternoon!!
The begining of really bad surprise.
We park the car in the middle of deprived, sensitive district.
Then, we went to Georgette Flat. 
Inside it stank of the food!!
We went downstairs and she showed us mattress for the night.
There was 2 mattress, one big with halo of all the colors so very dirty and another very fine which seems cleaner.
We decide to take both to make a correct bed.
Georgette left without told us where was toilet and bathroom.
The only thing told us was. ""You come inside one time and you go out one time"".
Bathroom is also very dirty without light.
The next day we left room at 9am.
She called us at 2pm when we was biking aroud amsterdam and we enjoyed to come back at her home to open the room door.
She wanted take one mattress for other people. It's amazing georgette doesn't have another keys!!!
So we had take bus to go there...
She harassed me by phone to konw where we are because she had got meeting elsewhere. She did it too at our arrival because we was late due to traffic jam near antwerpen.
We decide to sleep in the car the next day and forget her to take pleasure in this trip. We was so fed up with doing mission whereas we was in amterdam to take pleasure
Georgette is a stealer. She rent dirty room in a dirty district only to make profits. She doesn't know what is a hoost!!!
I don't understand how she can continue to rent rooms!!
I really disadvise to rent room to Georgette.
I hope she will delete in AIRBNB.
The badest experience in my life"
1,"William was the perfect host, could NOT have been better.
He is really a good host, and a really nice man.
The commuciation was very good, so before the stay I really felt safe to go there.
And that says a lot since I recently had a bad experience with this kind of stay.

The room was perfect, it had all we needed, and it was right in the heart af the city with walking ditance to nearly everything, at least the places we wanted to vist.
We didn't need the tram at all, or taxi for that matters.

If we travel back to Amsterdam, we surelly will contact William.

Did I mention taht all was perfect? :P

Thank you
"
-1,"Very bad experiences in this B&B, strongly not to recommend.
Here are the problems I had here:
1.Weak internet quality in my room:
My room is in the second floor corner and the internet quality is very weak while I use it in the room .I have stayed there two nights and forced to sit on the stairs outside my room to try to access the internet rather than using it in my room. No chair just sit on the small stairs and also bothering other tenants.

2.Very Very bad attitude from the B&B owner:
I told this problem about internet to the owner in the first day I arrived but owner advised it was too late to inform her so that she can not come in the first day. I accepted it and respect local people life because it was around 21:00 already. Next day, I left early for tour on second day and not able to reach landlord until16:30 because I was running out my prepaid card and only can use limited public wifi to reach her. I have made a call to her around 16:30 after bought prepaid card and ask what’s the better time for checking the internet but what I received was a negative and same answer again that it was too late to inform her, she can not come! It was only 16:30 in the afternoon! Most important , she kept talking in a bad tone and not allowed me to talk to her during our conversation AND suddenly hang up the call. Not even try to come to figure our what the problem is together and only require customers to suit her time. Very very rude.

3.The real flat condition is not comply with the description
Description states there are laundry and dry machine in the B&B but nothing there actually. I booked this room also in order to laundry my clothes.

4.Bad sound proof from other room.
As title. 
"
1,"We haven´t know Thea in person but her family was really hospitable, helpless and friendly.
Our room was pretty nice and we felt very welcome.
Unfortunaly it was a bit noisy because auf the proximity to Schipol airport.
Great was that we could park our car in front of the house, so we used the metro for driving to the centre. This was very relaxed.
We would recommend a stay for one or two nights."
1,"Nice place in a great location, close enough to the action but quiet enough to chill. Had everything we needed and just as described! "
1,The house is beautiful and in a wonderful location. Easy walk to museums and great restaurants. Nice bike ride to the center of Amsterdam. 
1,"The apartment is located in a nice area with many restaurants and bars, perfect for people who love being in the middle of action (though, it can be a bit noisy at night - the bedroom is located in the back of the flat, but also in the courtyard you can hear the noises from the restaurants kitchens and ventilation systems - better keep the windows closed if you are sensitive to noise). The flat has a nice balcony and is equiped with everything you need for a short stay (you can't cook a multicourse-menu, but it's perfectly fine for spending a nice evening in the flat, if you don't want to go to a restaurant - which you find plenty of them in less than a minute). Mo is a nice host (unfortunately we didn't meet him, we only wrote him) who is very flexible regarding the times and he was really understanding, that we had to change the arriving and departure times short term (again, thanks for that, Mo!). One thing you should be aware of is, that you have to share a 200x220 blanket - perfect for young couples and older couples who are still in love, but maybe not for everyone. Additionaly, the mattress is really hard, so if you need a soft mattress because of medical issues, I would not recommend to stay in this flat.
And be aware, that there is a washing machine (a pretty good one) but no tumble dryer, as it is mentioned in the equipment list.
We had little troubles regarding the cleanliness (as I mentioned, Mo was abroad, so I guess that was just an unfortunate exception) but all in all we really enjoyed our stay. We can recommend the flat to all singles and couples (which can handle some nights under the same blanket ;-) ), people who love living in the (sometimes noisy) heart of Amsterdam and who enjoy the huge selection of restaurants and bars and the perfect traffic connection (15 minutes to Amsterdam Centraal, nice for daytrips to Den Haag, Rotterdam, Leiden, Arnhem and so on)."
1,clean and comfortable with good transport link to central station. if your driving this place is a great option. Nadia is friendly. thanks
-1,"Centrally located, walking distance to all sights, this stylish as well as cosy appartment is a real pleasure. Altough several Restaurants and Bars are located right Next to the place, the appartment itself including the balcony is a quiet place.
Lifu is a very Kind host, whos always available for answering questions. The appartment is well equipped and perfectly clean. Definetly recommandable!"
1,"A top place to stay whatever the purpose of your trip to Amsterdam. Very close to the centre of the city so lots of things to do, but also located in a very quiet area whilst still having a nice atmosphere. Nice and clean apartment, and great to chill in for a few hours. The host was very kind and easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend. "
1,"I had such a great time here in your apartment. Very clean/very stylish & in the best part of town. I am extremely happy with my stay and I would stay again. Especially happy at the level of privacy and peace. Just a very beautiful place overall, such a sweet host & I would definitely recommend. Would be super cute for couples! Waking up to tea on the balcony and the birds singing in the trees around you.. it’s perfection. Thank you for letting me stay in your little piece of heaven. "
0,"Pros: 
The apartment was nice & clean.
Communication was good.
location was good, close to the Dam & next to the canal. 

Cons:
 It seemed that they just renovated cause there was still a heavy smell of paint .
There was awful construction noise from other apartments during the day, we complained one time & they stoped but continue the day after.

There was just 1 set of keys (for 3 people) we needed to duplicate one by ourselves.

There was not enough towels & the place didn't include any amenities.

Overall it had the feeling of a pure business & not a home, can't say that I enjoyed my stay.

"
1,"Staying in Judit's flat was a very pleasant experience.
We didn't get to meet Judit in person, but met with her Sister who was very helpful and kind.
The flat is lovely and comfortably clean with good facilities.
We felt fully at home."
1,"Everything was great, anything I needed was there and the host and hospitality were splendid. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good Airbnb."
1,"I stayed in Judit's studio for 5 days with my friend.
We rode by bus (#33) from Centraal Station to this place about 15-20 minutes. The bus runs every 10 minutes. This route also has the night bus.
Apartment was big, light and clean. There are comfortable double bed, kitchen, shower and balcony.
We had a nice stay in Amsterdam.
Thank you, Judit!"
1,excellent. thank you 
-1,"I really don't like being negative, but this place really was great and awful at the same time. The overall building and rooms were great and offer a great location. However, we weren't allowed to check in when we were promised, and the host didn't meet us. Other people did, and they wouldn't leave until three hours after we took the keys. The place wasn't clean, and I mean it was really dirty. Further, they had a cat living there and didn't say anything. My guest was allergic to cats. They didn't even clean the litter box, so the kitchen smelled terrible. They didn't take out the trash. They left glasses in the sink. The towels weren't ready. The rooms weren't cleaned. The refrigerator was full of food and leftovers, and there wasn't any room for us to buy things and put them in there. The location was great, and the host was responsive, but for the money we paid, it was hugely disappointing. I still can't get over how messy the place was. I'm probably forgetting even more things that were disappointing, but you get the idea. I cannot recommend anyone stay there. I'm sad to even write such a negative review. "
1,"Quirine's place is a lovely room located in a very quite area. Atmosphere is very cosy, there is also a lovely cat."
1,"My girlfriend and I spent three nights at Judit's place which totally met your expectations. Judit was a great host, always responding to our emails within a few hours and gave us a lot of flexibility with the check-in and check-out time. 

The accommodation is well equipped and just a 20 mins away with a bus (buses run every 10 mins) from the city center. We found the area nice and quiet, and there was a supermarket very close-by.

I totally recommend the place, if you are looking for a short and not expensive stay opportunities in Amsterdam."
1,"We were very comfortable in Carolina's home, it's far from Midtown but very easy to go with the direct bus. The garden is very nice for those who stay there in summer; you can rent a bike and have it there. There is no closet in the room but since we needed to hang things Carolina made space for us in the living room closet.

"
1,"Good and fast response. Apartment is a bit outside of the center, but good value."
-1,"The heating didn't work and no-one helped to fix it during our stay despite our request. The hot water in the bathroom is also sometimes a challenge. The apartment is well located and quiet but without heating in November, it just makes it awful to stay. "
-1,"Very bad experience . So We left the place as soon as we got there and went to a hotel.
Its almost impossible to get the apartment by car (our case) because of the Market, all streets are closed.
The pictures dont show the reality of the apartment. 
The stairs are awful and dangerous. Impossible to go up with luggage. Killer stairs. Sorry.
Standard of cleanness was so low. The maintenance was very poor, there is a loose step on the stairs to the top that is very dangerous.
There is no privacy on the bathroom. Besides that, it bathroom was rather gross (unfinished, seemed unclean), and smelled bad. 
When we go there no one was waiting for us. And the keys case were not working well, so we couldnt find the key. So we called her friends Tuur, never answer the phone and Matti was very rude. The first thing he asked me: “how did you get my number? since he has nothing with the apartment”. Then Piet show up. He is nice, very friendly.
Anyway, its not a good option. At least for me.
"
1,"Christiaan was amazing, my flight was delayed by an hour; so I arrived later than expected. Even though he was coming from outside the city, he was so understanding of the situation even though I felt awful. 

Would and will recommend 100%"
-1,"Read the other reviews and be warned. The host has awful people skills, is inflexible, does not listen. When I booked I clearly stated the booking was for more than one, saying that WE would like to stay, not I. However the host forced my sick daughter to sit in the cold stairwell while she went off on various tangents treating me like a fool. Fortunately the rest of my family stayed somewhere else - this was an emergency booking because of a last minute change in plans and the need for an extra bed.
Never again and I suggest others look elsewhere at far better options than this grotty hole."
1,Friedrich was an excellent host who was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. He was very easy to chat to but also respectful of our space. I would highly recommend Friedrich to anyone who is considering staying in Amsterdam 
0,My stay wasn't anything special. It was my first experience using Airbnb. The room was small and outdated but nothing too terrible. I would not recommend staying during the winter months as the windows do not seal properly and the portable space heater is insufficient for the job. The hosts seem friendly enough. They were out of town for my first day and night but showed up after 1am my second evening and made quite a bit of noise for the next couple of hours. Overall not a bad place to crash for a night or two but there are other options in this price range. 
-1,"That was, by far, my worst experience with Airbnb. The only positive thing is that the agency took responsibility for its errors and let us out of this awful place with no penalty.  "
-1,"First of all it is not directly rented from the host but some company who is arranging this. We could not check in in the place itself but had to go to their office... This was already highly inconvenient. We reached their office around 17:30 picked up the key and went to apartment - and the worst thing happened - they gave us wrong key... We struggled 20 minutes trying to open the door to the building but it was impossible. I have called the provided phone number but it was already after 18 so no one picked up. There was a voice machine telling me to stay on the line for an emergency but no one was picking up. I was panicking as didn't really have any alternatives and next day was a public holiday and whole city was packed with tourists. Fortunately the owner of the place was passing by and she saw us trying to open the door. Luckily for us she was able to give us her key so we could finally enter the place. If not her we would have to rent a hotel room... Additionally the information they have provided about the place was not accurate - they mentioned the WiFi which was not accessible - fortunately I was able to locate the router and read the correct name and password for WiFi myself. To summarize if we didn't by accident meet the host, we would have to rent the hotel room. Horrible communication with the company... They just send some automated emails regarding check in and check out. How can you give someone wrong key and not pick up the phone after ??? Really bad experience... The place itself was nice and everything else was fine, but the check in was simply not acceptable."
0,"Nice guy, decent room, nice bed, not the best location but not awful. Not worth £100 a night tho"
1,"We had a fantastic stay at Otto's houseboat. Though we did not get to meet Otto, the houseboat's manager, Mary, was very friendly and not only showed us around the houseboat, but also provided a website with lots of restaurant, cafe, and bar recommendations. 

The houseboat itself was about as picturesque as can be, and we were greeted by ducks and other boats when we stepped out into the deck. The interior was also very thoughtfully decorated and comfortable, and the neighborhood felt safe, yet close to lots of cool stuff.

The one thing that was a bummer was that the fireplace was off-limits, because of some bad experiences they have had with other renters. That said, the boat was still plenty warm enough with the radiators around the house. "
-1,"Apartment was really dirty. Lauri even stayed dirty dishes in the sink. All her stuff was everywhere, so we can't even put our things somewhere. Cat was awful! She was very angry, hissed every time. One good thing - is the place. It was really close to center, supermarket and so on. So if you want just to spend a little time (1-2 days) in this apartment - it's OK, but no more!"
1,"I want to start with the only mark of our holiday: the check-in.
It has been absolutely horrible cause we arrived with a few of delay at Schipol airport and Karstene (Daniel's mum - Daniel was in Bali, so his mum would have made the check-in for him -) was at the Concert Hall in the south of city... indeed, we had problems with conversation (due to the bad reception and the dutch english accent that doesn't feel so confortable to us... by the way, we've understood practically everything, the problem was that Karstene had said that she had gave the keys to neighbours, but when she gave us their number, we've spoken with a dutch family that didn't know a word in english! --&gt; WRONG NUMBER!
It was raining, we had just finished money on phone, and we were in the west of the city while Karstene was in the south... 
At the end of story, we had to check-in at 18:00, and we did it at 23:00... i definitely think that she should have managed better the situation.
Said this, Daniel's studio is AWESOME, we really recommed it. It's confortable, technologic and very very clean.
Pics not do justice to it. 
The only mark is the position: 20 mins from centre by bus.
Overall, Daniel's studio, in all its features (including position) is worth 5 stars. We decided to cut 1 star due to the bad experience of check-in.
If you're a couple like us, we think that Daniel's studio is the perfect location to enjoy a romantic holiday in Amsterdam... we did it! :-)

1,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on 8 February and had the most wonderful time. Nobody stayed on the boat the night before so Martin let us check in early and made us feel very welcome. He was very helpful and instantly put us both at ease. The weather was awful when we stayed but the boat was super cosy - so much so that we decided to spend more time on the boat than doing the other things we planned. My husband said the boat was actually the best part of the trip just because it was such a lovely space to be in. Thanks, Martin"
1,This place is wonderful for any Amsterdam getaway. Your right next to the metro so getting around is incredibly easy. Alon is a great host and has a great place for your next adventure. The balcony is one of the best touches to the place. I absolutely enjoyed my stay here and know you will to!
1,"Loved staying here! It was very clean, and more than enough room for the three of us. Close to a bus stop that takes you right into the city. Would recommend staying here. We were three american tourists who had no idea what we were doing and we figured it all out very quickly. "
1,"jeen's house is very (Website hidden by Airbnb) was ready more than I expected to found... everything was available, arranged and clean 
jeen's friend bjorn was a great person in communication and welcoming ....every thing here is good ..for sure I recommend it specially for families. ....I will come back again "
1,We had an excellent stay with Carolina. The place is about 15 minutes from Centraal by the bus and she provided us with a map and a small book of Amsterdam to help us. She was incredibly accommodating and very kind to us. Thank you!!
-1,Awful experience. Rodents in the kitchen ate our bread and the bag where the bread was stored stored. The apartment didn’t have the furniture displayed in the pictures. We had two chairs in really bad shape with duck tape on it. Shower head was broken and obviously no cleaning prior our check in.
1,Amazing flat in the centre of a lively part of town. Great roof terrace and lovelys rooms throughout. Stayed with five friends and would highly recommend. 
1,"After getting lost getting off the train at Central, Jol was happy to help us find our way with directions to our home for the next few days. We were greeted and shown around, given a book of very useful tips/maps, and also a couple of local beers and snacks. The boat was very clean and comfortable,  super stylish and practical for a short stay as a couple. The heating was used lots due to the awful weather we experienced, but going back to our little cabin after a long rainy day was so cozy! The bed was 100% the comfiest I’ve ever slept in, the shower was easy to use and we found all the extra amenities like the umbrellas and shopping bags so handy!
We didn’t get to use the bikes unfortunately due to the bad weather, but great that they were provided and would allow a 5 min ride to the centre!! (10 min walk)
10/10 stay, absolutely perfect for our first trip to Amsterdam! Thank you again to Steve and Jol for letting us share their beautiful home! "
-1,"This place is in an amazing location but has little else to recommend it. The apartment is in  disrepair, with a pervasive damp odour and grimy surfaces. I would not recommend this as value for money."
1,"Friedrich is an excellent host.  Welcoming and helpful.  We truly loved our time on the Rosita.  It was so much better than a typical hotel or room.  Staying on a boat on the canal in this location was absolutely perfect.  We were made to feel ""at home"".  The location is so convenient to many great sights and is an easy walk to shops, restaurants and transportation.  We had everything we needed close at hand.  The Rosita was very clean and comfortable.  It was a lovely experience that I would recommend to anyone!"
1,"This place is amazing. So clean, tidy, relaxing with the most comfortable bed. very central to all public transport, with parks, supermarkets and restaurants outside the door. 
I recommend this place to anyone travelling and staying in Amsterdam. 10/10"
-1,"The apartment was very nice and very conveniently located, regarding the apartment itself the livingroom was spacious, the windows were large and there was plenty of light. The bathroom was big as well. The bed was very comfortable. The decoration was fancy and modern.

Despite all these nice details it lacked some essential points: the kitchen was unprovided of any tools (the coffee machine was broken) there weren't any of the basics, as oil, salt, sugar, tea, nor any other cooking basic ingredient. There wasn't soap in the bathroom, and there was dirty clothes left in the dirty clothesbasket, non washing-soap either. 
The person who received us wasn't inviting at all, and couldn't solve the wifi problem, and took 24 hours to answer my complains. 
Great apartment, poorly provided and awfull hosting. "
1,"The Gardenhouse is lovely. The beds are comfortable, the shower is great, and it has everything you could possibly need inside. The weather was awful when we were there but with the electric blankets and heaters it wasn't a problem at all. Karen and her husband were really friendly and helpful and provided loads of advice for our stay and even printed tickets out for us. The area is nice and it is easy to get to the city centre. I would definitely recommend Karen's Gardenhouse and I would stay here again if I came back to Amsterdam.
Thanks, Karen!"
1,"We spent 2 nights at Emil's accommodation. It's located in a working-class neighborhood with many black residents. The accommodation is very simple, but clean, and the surrounding is save. The car can be parked directly in front of the house which is very comfortable. The bed is comfortable but squeaking at every slight move. Emil is a very nice and friendly host who respected our privacy. He has a small sweet dog and a cat that are living with him in this room. The animals are only in his room and do not come out. Email also gave us some tips for our city trip. The breakfast he offered was fine and delicious with all you need. The next Metro station is a 10 minutes walk away, and by metro it takes you about 15 minutes to get to the city centre. What we missed was a mirror in our room. The light in the bathroom is very poor, so it's nearly impossible to put on makeup there. The room and the kitchen was not exactly (any more I guess) as shown on the pictures. Anyway, we had a good time and Amsterdam is really worth a trip."
0,"location is great, the bath tub is not really good, it need a cortain or somehting."
1,"Judit was a warm, friendly host. The room was very clean and neat when we arrived, and it's a perfect, minimalist room for two people on a budget. We stayed two nights, and Judit let us use her storage to leave our luggage after we checked out. One bus ride away from the center, highly reccomendable! "
-1,"Sorry to say that the House Boat did not fill my expectations. It was more like a Hostel.  
I would not consider the Toilet to be ""en suite""."
1,Really good experience!
-1,"Our flight was delayed but Sandra's friend waited for us for an hour to let us in which was greatly appreciated. However, on arrival we found the TV and both lamps didn't worked (neither were resolved even after asking the host). The room was 25+ degrees inside and did not cool down for the whole 3 days; it was pretty unbearable. The blind behind the bed broke every time we drew the blind, and the chest of drawers was sticky and unclean and many of the bed slats were broken. The shower/bath was disgusting with dirty water sat in the bottom full of other peoples hair and dirty and never drained, you had to stand in this when showering and it was very unhygienic. Good tram and bus links outside but 30 minute tram the centre (Dam). There was not much food in the fridge available so we bought our own food and kept it in the cupboard (which also had a broken drawer.) For an 18-year old couple on their summer holiday together it was very disappointing and we would not recommend this place."
1,"As a result of the awful weather and 3 cancelled and delayed flights in less than 12 hours, we ended up arriving after midnight instead of 2pm. Despite that, and being well within his rights to tell us to find a hotel instead, Marcel still let us stay. He communicated brilliantly and helped find solutions for us as we tried to get to Amsterdam. The room is beautiful. The bed is huge and really comfortable. There are lovely welcoming touches. With another cancelled flight today an my only way home a 7am flight out again I didn't get a chance to spend time in the neighbourhood BUT I know the area well and can say honestly Marcel's place is the perfect location for a visit to Amsterdam. He is certainly the perfect host!"
1,Larry and Liz were nice hosts and the description of the appartment was very accurate.
-1,"It was a very bad experience at Bunmi’s place. We took the room for three because it was say in the description that it can be for 3. When we arrived there were a strong smell of weed, only a double bed, and Bunmi told me that he tought that we were going to sleep at 3 in this single bed. Moreover there were no locker on the door, so it is not very safe. Thus we didn’t even sleep at this place we came back home because it was just impossible to stay here! Finally, Bunmi wasn’t nice at all, he did not even say sorry, and was not welcoming at all! I do not recommend."
1,"La casa si trova in una buona posizione. C'è il tram a pochi passi dalla casa che ti porta in centro, ma per chi ha voglia di camminare, in 20 minuti a piedi si arriva a piazza Dam. Noi invece abbiamo noleggiato le bici e ci siamo trovati benissimo, in circa 10 minuti si è in centro.
La camera è al piano inferiore, un pó piccola e senza balcone ma è arredata nei minimi dettagli, è pulita, ed ha tutto ciò di cui si ha bisogno, soprattutto per chi come me in camera ci resta davvero poco tempo. Bagno molto confortevole, anche se come nel resto dei paesi del nord manca il bidet.
Appena arrivati c'è stato un problemino perché in chat Tina mi aveva indicato una stanza diversa e perché i ragazzi che erano già in casa avevano scambiato le chiavi, ma pur non essendo presente, Tina è stata molto disponibile al telefono ed il tutto è stato risolto.
Consiglio questa camera. Grazie Tina, siamo stati davvero bene nel tuo alloggio.

The house is in a good location. There is a tram just a few steps from the house that takes you to the center, but for those who want to walk, a 20 minute walk to Dam Square. We have rented bikes and we had a great time, in about 10 Minutes is in the center.
The room is downstairs, a small pony and no balcony but it is furnished in the smallest details, it is clean, and has everything you need, especially for those like me in the room there is really little time left. Very comfortable bathroom, although as in the rest of the northern countries, the bidet is missing.
Just arrived there was a problem because in chat Tina had indicated a different room and because the guys who were already in the house had exchanged the keys, but while not present, Tina was very helpful on the phone and everything was solved.
I would recommend this room. Thank you Tina, we really enjoyed your stay.

1,"We spent a great time in Veerles appartment. The neighbourhood is really nice and close to the centre. But the parking situation there and anywhere else in Amsterdam is quite awful. So if you have the chance to leave your car at home, I highly recommend it. 

Veerle was a good host and always answered quite fast to our emails.

1,"Chris and Tine's place was excellent for our short mini-honeymoon to Amsterdam. From beginning to end, we greatly enjoyed our stay.

It was easy to communicate with them prior to check-in and they even accommodated an earlier check-in, which was much appreciated after our overnight flight from NYC. 

The house is beautiful and decorated extremely well. We loved the feeling of making coffee from the elevated kitchen and watching the world walk by along the canal. The tub was a little bit of an experience for us tall Americans, but we recommend sitting within it to shower :) We didn't have any issues with getting around the space, but the multi-level nature of the home does lead to some steep stairs that we would not recommend for older travelers or those traveling with small children.

The location was wonderful for exploring the city. We loved the restaurants and walking along the canals nearby, and we walked almost everywhere during our rainy stay. We really appreciated the guidebook with recommendations left by Chris and Tine and wholeheartedly agree that there is no real reason to head into the city center.

We would highly recommend Chris and Tine's home."
-1,"The host is really bad. I can't believe that I've lived there for four nights. The first time I read his description on the website, no name or no photo and lots of rules, no kindness. Throughout the journey, I've never seen him even I doubt that he doesn't live here. We only communicate by message of airbnb and he never use his phone. Worse, his English is too poor to understand and communicate.      

The objective description. This is a Arabian society which is good and clean. Ten minutes by walk to several stations nearby. Inside the house, the smell is awful, apart of bedroom, the rest are all locked. In the room there's only one spring bed and a computer chair, no other things useful. When you sit or fall on the bed, you will sink in. I can't find a dustbin in my room or toilet or bathroom. Everything I should prepare myself.

The cleaning affaires. The host leaves me a small plastic bag as dustbin. I should throw all the things including the toilet paper into this small bag. No one changes the bag or cleans the room. So the third day, I send a message to host and let him fuifil his duty. He just told me how expensive to let the lady work. But every guest pay the cleaning fee at first, the host has the duty to keep my room clean. I don't care who does the cleaning, he or the lady. But the host only promised to give me another bag and said ironically that I'm not a grown up. I've paid 60euros before, I just fight for my right. Finally the host refunded the cleaning fee to me. The fact shows that he does nothing but asks the cleaning fee for every guest. He prefers to quit money than do little things himself. Another thing is the quilt cover never be changed because the lady only clean the floor and change the bedsheet. 

About my arrival. The host promised that I can get the key when I arrive. However, I pushed the doorbell, nobody replied. I called his phone number, never connected. With the help of neighbor's brother, I got into the building and I tried to knock the door, nobody answered either. The host answers me by message only, never call me or send messages. He didn't care about how let me in but just told me not to talk to neighbors. How ridiculous without their help, maybe I will wait for a long time. Finally I get in the house by the help of another guset who occasionally goes home.
 
I've used airbnb and met several really nice hosts. But this is the worst. Since the host doesn't let us know his name or all the true informations, never appears, he never let us use anything except toilet and bathroom without dustbin, his English is so poor and his altitude is so rude. I don't recommend this place strongly.
"
-1,"Very bad experience, unfortunately. The moment I opened the door to Willem's apartment in Amsterdam, I was greeted by a strong, foul smell. The smell got stronger as I climbed up the stairs into the apartment. Willem was not there, but his assistant Rick was. I mentioned the smell, and Rick apologized to me about it. The room was very small, and the apartment was messy, but the main problem was the intolerable foul smell, so I asked to connect to the internet to find alternative accommodations. The internet didn't work either, so I asked Rick to tell Willem to cancel the reservation, and I left less than five minutes after I arrived. I found alternative accommodations through Airbnb, which were up to the usual good Airbnb standards (see my positive review of Remco's Amsterdam apartment).

I contacted Willem the same evening to obtain a refund for my booking, but instead of graciously apologizing for the intolerable state of his apartment, he simply denied that there was any problem, and refused to cancel the booking or issue a refund. His lies and unethical behavior continued through several more days of my attempts to get the issue resolved, so I was required to lodge a complaint with Airbnb. Fortunately, Airbnb handled the matter professionally and issued a refund plus a $30 discount voucher for my next Airbnb booking.

I recommend that Airbnb users are very careful when booking with Willem. The photos and description of his apartment are misleading, and if you have any issue, he will simply lie about it and you will have to go through a painful and time-consuming process of dispute resolution."
0,"Our stay at Benno's place was okay. Our group felt like the photos were a lot nicer than the actual apartment. Also I wasn't aware that people on the street can see us in our bedroom upstairs through the glass floor! The bathroom wall out to the hallway is also glass (tinted)- be aware if you are traveling in a group and don't want to see each other naked! Also the door in the bathroom is glass (tinted). The internet played up in our last 2 days, despite contacting both Benno and the manager Fraser, the issue wasn't resolved. The house lacked some basic essentials- no soap to wash hands and no spare towels. 
He was kind enough to let us leave our bags for few hours after our check out so we could explore the city more before our afternoon flight (thanks again for that!) The location is great to catch trams, literally 5mins walking distance. It's 15min walk from a train station where you can arrive from the airport which is great and long walk (40-50mins) into the city centre. 
Overall we had a great time in Amsterdam but was a bit disappointed with the house. "
1,"This is a most special place and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to stay. There is a sense of calm and grace in the apartment, both from the design and its heritage. The views are stunning as is the quality of the light.  I felt very much at home, which was amazing.

I had the chance to check-in early, and the check-in itself was friendly and welcoming, as was the visit to the exhibit space on the ground floor. All questions were replied to in a quick and friendly manner. 

The more I travel the more I realize the importance of trying to be respectful of the environments which host us, and to make conscious choices about how I travel. By staying at Castrum Peregrini I think I may have had the opportunity to do both. "
0,"Friendly host who was communicative throughout, and was OK with an early check in. The unit is quite small, and up some very steep stairs. Although called a B&B no breakfast is provided, only a microwave. This was a little disappointing, considering the high seasonal rates.

The storage area immediately next the room is used throughout the day so it can be noisy in the daytime. Wifi works well, and the balcony was a nice touch.

The building shares the street with lots of restaurants, and a Heijin supermarket next door. Easy access to anywhere you need to go in the city, with a bike hire shop close, and tram stop opposite the front door."
1,"Andrea was a wonderful host! Room is very nice, exactly like on pictures. Apartment is well placed! My best experience on airbnb. Highly recommend this place to stay in Amsterdam!!"
-1,"NIGHTMARE!! We chose Roberts houseboat based on the reviews. While the boat was pretty enough and in a good location, our experience with Robert as a host was awful.

It all started with us arriving half an hour later than our estimated time of arrival. We followed Robert's instructions on how to take a tram but found ourselves getting lost. On our arrival, Robert seemed upset so we apologized for our delay.

He then showed us around the apartment with detailed instructions and a list of amenities that were in his description but would not available to us. Example: hairdryer  Warning: please check with him to make sure you get a fully functioning place.  We decided to let the lack of amenities go.

Before he left, Robert told us that he was expecting guests at 3.00 pm on the day of our departure. On the day of our departure, we cleaned the house thoroughly even scrubbing the toilet and dusting and wiping every surface since we wanted to help Robert leave the place completely clean for his next guests. 
We had our bags fully packed up and left them by the door at noon. 5 minutes past noon Robert hadn't arrived and we decided to go get a cup of coffee around the corner. We sent Robert an e-mail and also left him a note on the dining table saying that we'll be back shortly.

We came back 20 minute later to find a hysterical Robert screaming at us. We were so shocked that we kept apologizing and appeasing but he got crazier. We started feeling completely threatened and literally had to grab our bags and almost run for fear.

When we tried to point out that we had helped out by cleaning the place for his next guests, Robert claimed that there were no other guests expected. 

It does not end there. After we left, Robert sent us 1000 word long e-mails upset and saying that it doesn't matter if we had a miserable time. 

I've been an AirBnb host/guest for over 2 years now and never have I ever encountered anything like this. Robert proved himself to be an unreliable and unstable host.  

I would highly recommend AGAINST Robert's place."
1,Nice friendly host.
1,"Nice and clean appartment outside the citycentre. Balcony that gave some air, and even some view, and the convenience of a grocerystore in the immediate surroundings.
Close to the busstop, buses runing often and with the 24h pass you also get acces on the night buses."
1,"Our stay at Liz's housboat was fantastic, Liz is a great and attentive host. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We liked the location as it was close to many attractions. In the end of the day you can rest at the terrace with nice view of the canal. Definitely would come back. "
-1,"Architecturally as represented. On arrival no Internet, and unclean. Email to host was responded to with apologies and promises of Internet and cleaning. All downhill from there. Cleaning happened, but no Internet for the next five days (very serious for us with implications for our livelihoods but ongoing promises that a mobile wifi would be delivered meant we stayed instead of leaving - which is what we should have done). The host is out of town with no Internet access, apparently, and didn't give us a number to call, so we couldn't communicate with her. Not a ""luxury"" experience by any means. Basic, well-used towels and sheets. Old, dirty pots and pans. No cooking utensils whatsoever. A broom but nothing else to clean with. No groceries whatsoever. And so on. What you see in the photos is not what you get. No rugs, lamps, outdoor furniture... Eventually we asked for help from airbnb. I guess they got onto the host because a mobile wifi arrived in the post -- though it had a limit per day. In the end, we got a partial refund from airbnb for our trouble (thank you airbnb) but no response whatsoever from the host. As great as the place looks in the photos -- and as great as the location is -- we would never recommend this listing. It's such a pity because in the hands of another host, this could be a wonderful airnbnb experience. We use airbnb all the time and this is our only bad experience. A shame."
1,"We stayed at this fantastic penthouse for 14 fabulous days and enjoyed every moment. Of course Amsterdam is a great city but this apartment gave us all our creature comforts to make Amsterdam feel like our home for 2 weeks.
The location is great, after having stayed in busy the centre for a night and to get a little out of the touristic area (yet still in easy reach of the centre) makes your Amsterdam stay 1000x better! 
Mirak was a great host, helped us with the bags and always replied within a minute or two, he gave us tips on how to get around and what was going on in Amsterdam.
Nothing to fault, 5 stars and because of this we will definitely be back!!"
0,"There is no king bed. There are two twin mattresses with their own twin bedding and blanket next to each other, but no king bed (or even connector between them under a king sheet). Separate twin beds next to each other. All photos are outdated and the place could use some TLC. The bathroom is a utility closet with awful ventilation and water pressure (can't use the kitchen sink without the shower stopping), but if you bring flip flops and are used to a YMCA public gym shower you'll manage. The glass shelf in the bathroom is missing, the toilet is slightly loose,  there are some wall water stains near the entry and unusable hooks, and the living room windows don't fully close/lock. The host was friendly at check in, and was accommodating to two friends who needed to stay with us (taking our reservation from 2 to 4), BUT he (1) entered the apartment without asking when he thought we were out, and (2) said we didn't leave the cash for the extra people even though we did, exactly as he asked. He didn't want to go through AirBnB, and we definitely should have, even though we took photos of the table with cash/keys as we left to prove we paid (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1,Shamira's was very helpfull before I had made the reservation. The room had a lot of space and was clean. I've enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to others.
1,"My mom and I were set to travel to Amsterdam January 4th to stay at Ilse’s accommodations. She provided a number of amenities and was a very dedicated host, even offering to pick us up at the tram stop and set dinner reservations for us. It really seems like she thought of every little way to make our stay unique and comfortable. Unfortunately, our flight got canceled due to an awful snowstorm in New York, but all through that time, Ilse was in communication with Air BnB staff to help sort out arrangements and maintained direct communication with me. I plan on staying with her in the future for sure."
1,"Caroline's place was exceptionally clean and excellently appointed! 
The private entrance welcomes you to your own apartment on a quiet canal in the middle of Amsterdam! 
Caroline has provided many of the modern conveniences one might hope for, including a little fridge with yogurt, water, beer and juice, tea, coffee, candy, a clothes iron, hair dryer and a relaxing rain-shower!
Caroline was easy to reach, very pleasant and flexible regarding my check-in time.
The neighborhood is great, not too close to the crowded center, but still in very easy reach of all the main Amsterdam attractions. I walked most places, but the tram and busses are just two blocks away. There are many fun and yummy spots in the neighborhood itself, including restaurants, cafés, a sauna and shops.
My only complaint is that the walls are a bit too thin. I could hear every move the neighbors made, and perhaps they could hear me too. 
While I would certainly stay again at Caroline's place, I would suggest earplugs for the early-to-bed guests and maybe not recommend it for a couple on a romantic holiday.

-1,"A terrible experience. It took 40 minutes to find the store we were sent to for our keys -- the directions they gave us were not helpful. At the store, we were told there was a ""change of plans"" and that someone  would be meeting us at the apartment with keys. This was not true. We sat on a street corner for TWO HOURS, with a child, waiting for someone to come with keys. This was only resolved after we called Airbnb in San Francisco. When we got in, the apartment was filthy with trash everywhere, even though it was supposed to have been ready four hours prior. Then, the air mattress they left us had a hole in it. My husband slept on the floor for two days before they replaced it.  We had little (if no) actual communication with the owners. The property is managed by a very impersonal company that sends out standardized, cut-and-paste replies. If you're looking for a personal experience with a real host who strives to answer your questions and make you feel welcome, stay elsewhere! We only booked this reservation because our original reservation cancelled with three days notice, and I regret choosing this place. Oh, and there was a mouse in the apartment the last day -- which I guess is to be expected in these old homes, but that was just the icing on the cake on a bad experience."
-1,"We booked this place based on previous reviews. Not sure what has gone wrong since then. We found it most unsatisfactory. The shower screen and floor had soap scum on it. There was no bathmat, handtowel or soap provided. There was not even a teabag provided. There was some awful instant coffee. There were no instructions on how to use the TV. Normally we could work this out but the TV must be at least 20 years. The freezer was frozen over. In communication we were told if we needed anything to let them know. However, our request for bathmat, handtowel towel were ignored as was our request to order a taxi when we were leaving. This was the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had. Having said that we did not let it detract from our enjoyment of Amsterdam."
-1,"A key factor in renting the space was heat that was described as central heat given it was quite cold over New Years. Juri promised the apartment would be warm, but all that was provided was a 2000 watt space heater that kept our feet warm if we stood beside it. In addition the flat was a mess, dirty clothes hanging around, stained pillow cases, strange smell. We left after 1 night, although we were suppose to stay 4 nights. We gave ample notice of our departure, but Juri didn't provide any refund. Overall, pretty bad experience. "
1,"Beautiful houseboat. Warm hosts. Fantastic location with great views and a lovely area to sit outside. Internet was intermittent, but given this is a new property, I have no doubt they will fix it soon. "
1,Lovely location and room! It was great to wake up and sit on the veranda overlooking the canal and bridge. Liz was a lovely host too! Would highly recommend Fuoco Vivo for Pizza which wasn't far away too.
1,"Julie's place is a great spot to stay if you're in Amsterdam. She was a very friendly and welcoming host. She also gave us plenty of good recommendations. Amsterdam West was a neighbourhood we hadn't visited before, but we loved everything about it. City centre is within walking distance."
-1,"Not in the Red Light District. Bed bugs. Dirty. Light was hanging from ceiling. Overall, a bad experience. "
1,"Nadia was an ideal host and I had no problems in getting to her apartment, and the room as well as the facilities were just fine.  Nadia is welcoming and accommodating.  I also liked the complimentary tea and coffee!  "
1,"Lovely flat, clean and in quite location.
Lots of restaurants around and close to city. Great !"
0,"An interesting way to experience Amsterdam life. We were given the wrong directions from the parking garage, which left us wandering for 20+ minutes in below freezing temps. We never met Daan, but were greeted by his young son and given a tour of the boat. I was surprised with the small space and inside appearance compared to the pictures, but it was doable for a one night stay. I would recommend this space for 2 adults and 1-2 kids. Overpriced (€145 per night + €20 parking) for the amenities, but a unique way to spend time in Amsterdam. The boathouse is connected to their family's boat, so not extremely private, as some curtains didn't fully close and was directly across from the other boat's windows. Not a bad experience, just a bit disappointed for the money paid."
1,"S & S were very welcoming, hospitable and helpful. I felt at home, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Thank you!

-1,"An overall negative experience:

We initially booked the garden apartment. Marfi (the host) contacted us a few days before the stay date and told us she had a double booking and needed to have us stay in the apartment above. We insisted on the importance of the garden and she managed to make sure that we could stay there anyways.

We stayed in the Garden apartment and never met the host. Instead, we met ""Roemer"" who was staying there for a while and taking care of certain aspects for the host (as I understand it) and gave us the keys.

There was a very strong smell of humidity/damp in the apartment which is situated below street level and at garden level. We were told to open windows and put the heating on full to avoid this. The smell was very strong. 

We arrived on Thursday and discovered that our apartment had no internet. We informed Roemer who managed to install a rooter on Saturday morning. In the end we had internet up and running by Saturday evening. Made the first few days quite difficult (no possibility to surf the net for local activities, restaurants museums etc...).

The noise isolation between the apartment levels is absolutely awful. We could literally hear every foot step above us. Thursday night we were woken up at 01h00, 03h00 and again at 07h30. Friday and Saturday were the same.

The oven in the kitchen has not been cleaned in a while. Bread crumbs, stains and grease. There were food stains on the crokery and cutlery.

Despite all our complaints, no solution was offered (except for the internet). Roemer told us he had informed Marfi about this but we never heard from Marfi...no call, no mail during or after the stay. 

We would definitely not stay here again.

Positive points:

The location is not bad. Close to shops, restaurants and central points."
-1,"The sleepingroom met our expectations. It was really nice!
The house location was perfect near to the water channels and very central.
Unfortunately the host was not there due to vacation.

The points which disappointed us was first of all that we had to share the apartment with 4 other guests.
We didn't expect to share the toilet and shower, which by the way were really small, with the other guests.
Due to the fact that more people were living with us it was loud. Particularly the door to the patio. We heard the door till late in the night.
We chose a private home to escape a bit from tourism and the traffic 
but at the end it was exactly the opposite.

The place was the 229€ for one night not worth it.
"
-1,"Worst stay ever! We had a tiny room for the three of us, barely any space at all. We were as quite as we could only be, but Liz's boyfriend would keep telling us we are banging on the doors. It's not our problem that the locks, doors and the house accoustic is crap. That was SOO annoying!

The neighborhood is awful. The kind of place where you'd better be home before 7 pm.

The funniest thing was that we were accused of breaking the bed when we were leaving.

It was the worst airbnb experience for me. Even worse than when I was freezing with no heating."
1,"Merel is an amazing host! Very friendly and helpful, she even went an extra mile (which she did not have to) and let us leave our luggage a bit longer in the apartment (as our flight was very late in the evening).
The apartment itself - you couldn't ask for more - bright, clean, with everything you might need!  Very quiet street, 10min by foot from I Amsterdam sign (and museum district), you have everything you need just around the corner (literary) - Yoghurt Barn - fantastic breakfast place, pubs and restaurants, Albert Cuyp Market, The Butcher - homemade burgers. I could not recommend Merels apartment enough! We fell in love with Amsterdam and next time we will be visiting (and we definitely will!) - we will try to stay in Merels apartment as we could not ask for better location!
Merel, thank you again for everything!
Karolina and Kamil."
1,"Thanks a lot for the hospitality, the boat and the service were outstanding"
1,"Communication with Nadia was fast and east all the time. Nadia flat is very well connected to the city center by metro and bus. The room is very nice and well equiped. She is kind and explains very well anything you need to move around. Also she have a very good price for value given the prices of Amsterdam and closeness to the city center. She gives only restricted access to the rest of the house (except toilet and shower) since she had a bad experience in the past with guests and she lives there. It is the first host I have been where this happen, so make me feel a bit unconfortable. What I like of Airbnb is not only the lower prices, but also the experience of getting to know local people. But, my experience is in general positive and I would recommend her has a host if you wish to be at your own in a well located and good price place. If you look more for the feeling of being at home and get to know a bit of local people, maybe it is not the best place. Nadia thank you anyway. It was a pleasant visit and you have a very nice house.
"
-1,"Staying at Jeroen's was the absolute worst experience I have ever had with airbnb.  His roommates were awful to deal with. They made me extremely uncomfortable to stay there and I should have just checked out right away as the situation was very uncomfortable.  The house smelled like nooone had ever cleaned the kitchen or refrigerator when I arrived which was eventually delt with.  I was so uncomfortable I litteraly was forced to try to stay in my rented room, not able to use the toilet or main spaces when they were in the home in attempt to avoid them because they made me so uncomfortable to have to encounter.  I dont reccommend to deal with Jeroen."
1,"Book now! I cannot recommend Andy's flat enough. He was a friendly and welcoming host with a great, spacious place. We didn't book far enough in advance so we had to stay in a hotel the last night which was awful (and more expensive) compared to this flat. It is clean, newly furnished and very comfortable. The beds and duvets are lovely. There is a fridge and great coffee machine there too. Andy also gave us the discount card for the local supermarket. The tvs in each room have several English channels.

The flat and cute terrace are on the top of Andy's house. The stairs are very, very steep, but this is typical with the construction and architecture  in Amsterdam. Andy was gracious enough to take our bags up and down the stairs.

I would absolutely return! Highly recommended."
1,"Linda was very accomodating in assisting us to see around Amsterdam and was always available whenever we had any questions. The locality of the appartment is very close to all cafes and shops and just a 20 minute walk to Centrum.
We cannot thank Linda enough for making us feel welcome."
-1,"Unfortunately, the flat wasn t exactly like on the pictures. the bed linen was dirty we had one matress on the floor and one double bed  in one room, the cooker didn t work, and the bathroom was a common bathroom. And that is not quite the flat you would expect for 185€ per day. Bad experience i would definitely not recommemd it."
-1,"Location of the Appartement was very nice. However, this Appartement needs urgently refurbishment as lots of things are broken or not even installed.  I would not recommend it on very cold Winter days, as you will freeze."

1,Anna made me feel very welcome. The room was as described with a lovely view and a comfy bed. I enjoyed my stay very much!
0,"Great location, stylish flat (if a little scruffy round the edges) and coffee machine with free coffee is a nice touch. The balcony? A godsend. 

One of the rooms is essentially 4 people in 1 huge bed; which is cool if you are into that kind of thing. I certainly was.... others not so much.

6 adult males sharing one pot was a little trying at times, but ample TP was provided.

N.B. Not sure Lin actually exists, which is sad as I was keen to meet her, so don't get your hopes up.

Mark my words..... the coffee shop (Cafe Crush?) across the road is awful, so don't even bother. Not much further to the Bulldog and some other classics, worth the extra effort."
1,lovely place great host. Highly recommend
1,"Stayed with Carolina for three nights and had a brilliant time. The room is really nice and Carolina is a great host, and we loved sitting out in the garden with a beer in the evenings! Would definitely recommend. "
1,"We had a fantastic time by experiencing to live on a houseboat in the middle of the city. Spending a few nights on water, is definitely worth to try.  The location cannot be better: close to tourist attractions (just walking distance) and to grocery stores. It was very clean and in great condition."
1,"Andrea was an incredibly welcoming and accommodating host.  Over the past month, my friend and I have rented from 6 different hosts and Andrea was by far our favorite.  The room was very clean and exactly as advertised in the listing.  The fresh towels and bathrobes were also greatly appreciated.  Although the house was shared, Andrea was very considerate about giving us privacy during our stay.  If you don't mind a 25 minute metro ride to the city center, I would highly recommend renting this room."
-1,"In one word, terrible.  Rose did not provide her address to me on AirBnB site, and this resulted in my having to wait from 1130pm until almost 100am until we made contact, and then, it was her boyfriend,  not she, who let me in the room. Once he left, I noticed small bugs in the room, and only 1 electric outlet,  forcing me to choose between charging my phone or having a lamp. I have never encountered such in the dozens of AirBnB places where I have stayed.  I wrote an email to AirBnB regarding this matter,  and especially considering how much I paid,  this was just awful."
1,"Niels was on holidays, but he wrote us some good guidetips and put beer for us cold:Phis friend Nancy welcomed us. She was very nice and gave us her number for problems or questions.  
We will surley visit Amsterdam again and can stay at Niels house!:)"
-1,"The apartment is nice, very well located but not properly furnished: only two glasses, nothing to cook. In the bathroom the shower stick was broken and there was not enough hot water to take a shower when you are four people. 
IMPORTANT THING: this is an agency using Airbnb for more visibility. But they are not running the business professionally.
BIG lack of informations and communication. No checkin, no informations regarding the checkout time despite I asked. Big surprise on Sunday morning when at 10:30 a cleaning lady came into the apartment. We apparently had to do the checkout at 11am but nobody told us. 
We had a phone call with Jan-Willem the manager of the agency whom was not respectful AT ALL. 
Very bad experience 
"
1,"Constanze is a beautiful soul and treats guests like family arriving.   Very helpful and communicates well.   Adds special touches too.    We loved our stay in Amsterdam.   Great location.  Hip and trendy vibe in the area.  Great shops and market and bakery blocks away.  

HELPFUL:  you can buy tram tickets at the bookstore on the corner.   You don’t have to go all the way to central station to get them.    Best way to get around the city and Constanze provides the best maps and tour info.    "
1,Very nice welcome and super helpful. Good location and comfortable room. Highly recommendable!
-1,"This Airbnb experience was traumatizing. It's probably best to break this down into pros and cons.

Pros: The location is great. It's easy to get here from Amsterdam Central. It's about a 20-25 minute walk. The host greeted us at the exact time we arranged to arrive and was very nice.

Cons: Her brother broke into the apartment via the balcony window at 3:30 in the morning. Keep in mind we we're all sleeping and the apartment is located on the second floor. We had the balcony door cracked open a bit since the apartment was hot. There were no windows, just balcony doors. He scaled the wall to get in. We woke up to a man climbing over the balcony. We had no idea it was her brother and assumed it was a burglar. We had to slam the door shut so he couldn't get into the apartment and he jumped back down to the street level. He then started saying screaming ""are you airbnb?"" We didn't respond right away and screamed back ""who are you?"" He then said he's the host brother and took off on his bike. At that moment we contacted the host to try and find out if this guy was her brother or an actual burglar. Her phone was broken so she was not able to respond until the following morning. Needless to say, none of us could sleep for the rest of the night. She confirmed the next day that the guy who broke in was her brother and apologized. This message did not come until hours after it happened. 

Other then break-in, the bathroom had a strong mildew odor. The shower curtain was broken and fell twice while we showered. There was pulling water and tissue trash in the bathroom. A few dirty dishes were also left in the sink. Clothes were left in the washing machine. 
 
We're still a little traumatized from this awful experience. Other then a ""sorry message- my brother was drunk"" the host did not try to rectify this terrible mistake with any kind of refund.

1,"Me and my two friends had a lovely stay at Nick and Olga's, they are both very sweet and accommodating. The room is great value, and the apartment in general is very homely. The only thing was that it got a bit hot in the room (it was very sunny) because of the glass windows, but better that than too cold, and we had some mosquitos in the room, but again that's just a fact of life. "
1,"Eveline is very friendly, and she gave us very good advice for our stay in Amsterdam. Her apartment is cozy and everything we needed was there. Thank you for all!"
0,"The BAD: The dishes had to be washed before we could use them. Many had stuck on food and the oven needed cleaning. This wan't awful. I've noticed this sometimes happens at Airbnb's.  The real issue was the smell of raw sewage coming from the center downstairs bathroom. At first, i thought my dad was being dramatic or exaggerating, but nope. Everyone smelled it. It was sewage. I think there must be some sort of backup when water is used. It is particularity noticeable when you take a shower. This is the tiny bathroom downstairs next to the middle bedroom. We had to keep the door closed the entire stay and didn't use the bathroom. My  4-year old was sleeping in that bedroom, so i didn't want her breathing that in. Another issue, which i thought was insanely dangerous, was the nail sticking out of the floor upstairs, which is stepped on. I cleaned up the blood, and have had a tetanus shot, but I would have lost my ever loving mind if my daughter had stepped on it. I tried to bend it back, but it really needs to be hammered down.  It is in the loft by the rear row of chairs. Oh, and my daughter found a bag of pot in the sofa. That's probably not a good place to keep it. I called you guys once and my dad called again. I'm not sure if I'll count his phone call, as he may not have done it correctly. I heard back once from I guess was your answering service.  They said someone would call me, but I never heard back. 
Another issue was the heat downstairs. It was insanely hot. I mean sweat shop hot and freezing upstairs. 
I really could have used an instruction manual or some information on the apartment. We didn't know how to work anything. Usually Airbnb's have some kind of ""instruction manual"" or information on what to do. I'm under the impression that this place is rented out constantly and pretty much handled exclusively by a management company and not the owner. 
THE GOOD: The location was fantastic. The space is large. I didn't find the media room usable with a child. It was too dangerous, particularity with the nail sticking up and no railing. One of the bathrooms was lovely."
-1,"We were a tad disappointed with this Airbnb mainly because it wasn’t as clean as we would have liked. Marieke let us check in early and communicated in a timely manor and we appreciate that! The fridge hasn’t been cleaned out in a while and let out an awful smell when you opened the door, the counters were stained and sticky and the shower floor didn’t look the cleanest. We’re not too picky about where we stay but do find cleanliness to be the most important. If they change that then it’s great!"
1,"Lovely clean apartment, beautiful furnishings, and amenities. Great location, only 20 minutes on the tram to the city. Jos was great. Good communication but would have much rather known before hand weed wasn’t to be smoked. We felt awful having the neighbours frown when we wasn’t to know. Jos ensured check in & our was flexible which was very kind. 
A home away from home :)"
-1,"Many things wasn't as it was expected in our accomodation:
1)We were informed from the host about some 'slightly renovations' but it turned out that the first  and the second flour was a construction sight!
2)The dirtynes and the filthynes in the kitchen (mud,squalor,dusτ,dirty dishes from previous customers apparently, dirty sink,fridge full of used food from previous customers) was unspeakable!
3)mud and dust in every stairway.
4)The first thing we saw in the third flour was a used towel in the Laundry.
5)A damaged(it is in the pictures of the house)  table that we were unable to use for eating all together because every time two of us held it for the rest of us to eat properly.
6)The Internet connection was truly awful.We couldnt even put a song on youtube or the most important to do our research for tomorows sightseeing.Thank god some of us had data in our smartphones.
7)Used sampoo in our bathroom
8)We never saw the hostess neither when we arrived nor when we left.
9)We we were accused from the host that we stole two pillows thats not acceptable and completely out of reality.
10)Every morning the construction stuff started working at 7 a.m and as a result we woke up at 7 every morning. What made us truly mad was the fact that every morning  we were waking up because of the noise the workers made.

Summing up we had an awful airbnb experience in this house and we are strongly going to consider using airbnb in our future trips!"
1,"Amazing place, just far enough outside of the city where it’s not too touristic, awesome places just a walk away, so much space and very comfy "
-1,"DON’T GO!! I don’t recommend at all!!! We had very bad experience there because we stayed 4 nights but NO HOT WATER for 2 nights. The owners and the agents are totally irresponsible, inconsiderate and cold!!! Bad attitude! Never on time! They didn't make sure if everything in the apartment is working before rent out the apartment. If we didn’t continuously asking/texting/calling them to fix the boiler, we would have no hot water for 3 nights. No hot water was very unacceptable, but the owners and the local agents didn’t fix the problem quickly, and even with such bad attitude, and didn’t on time when they said they are coming to fix the boiler. That affected and delayed our travel plans a lot!! The agents even said that we can stay at the apartment anyways even without hot water; and said the thing just happen sometimes. 

I mean, the apartment itself is good, except for the very steep stairs, and the location is not bad. But if you ever have any difficulties with the apartment, they are not there to help you. Very irresponsible.

Our trip in Amsterdam would absolutely be better if we chose another apartment or other hotels."
1,"Herman and his girlfriend were fantastic hosts! The apartment is at a perfect location, all around the house are bike shops for rental, small cafés and restaurants. It's in between the lovely Vondelpark and a small canal. The apartment itself was super clean and was prepared with everything you could ask for, even with small local Snacks and a couple of fresh & cold Heinekens.
The kitchen offers everything you need and the small backyard is amazing in the morning to have a good cup of coffee.

Herman was responding immediately and was super flexible in time, which has made it really easy for us when it comes to Pick up/Drop off the keys.
Thanks for the great time in Amsterdam! "
1,"For those who like travelling this flat will be an excellent choice! 
Nick and Olga are very kind and hearted people and always help you with problems. The apartment is cozy and spacious enough, so nobody feels oppressed. The flat is located in quiet and calm area. It will take you just only 15-20 minutes to get to the center of Amsterdam by the metro. Also you can take a bicycle ride with scenic views and reach the center in one hour.
Nick and Olga allowed us to use everything in the flat that can be useful for preraring food. This fact saved our patience and money. There were no limits about homecoming hours in the apartment. And we also received our own pair of keys.
Accomodation in this flat was very comfortable, warm and not noisy! I highly recommend this place!
Anton and Olga."
1,"very kindly host,and very cute cats.i will be back here.trust me,thats a good select.
u have to taste the hand made jam…so delicious!"
-1,"I appreciated the reception, but I regret the lack of intimacy in the room, due to very thin walls. We didn't even dare to speak and laugh normally, not to disturb the others."
1,"Very cosy apartment, ideal for weekend breaks. Great location, not too central but not too far from everything you would need."
-1,"Everything was very confusing. We got greeted by a young man. Said that the keys were locking the rooms doors, they didn't. Then we spoke to a lady on the phone, then another girl came to check up on us...This is not an apartment but it's more set up like an asylum, his is what we called it. No windows can open. Theres no proper living room or group space. There is not a table of 16 like mentioned. 0 charm, 0 sens of community, just rooms and white corridors. We had an awful experience and were really deceived when we got there. It says Lin's apartment, we never saw Lin and thats not an apartment. It's some sort of a weird establishment like an old dormitory. We also got robbed and it took them hours to react saying like we were making it up. Were a group of 10 people between 35 and 45 on a business trip, we had no time to argue and put the blame upon ourselves to not dramatize and get to work but unless your a group of 19 years old on a field trip, none of us would recommend this place.
It's not the environment we were looking for. The whole idea was to be able to work in a nice big kitchen at a table of 15 people. The table is a table for 8 and it doesn't fit your description nor the fact that its an apartment or a home. It's nothing like a home nor a mansion. Really should have read the description further and better and asked more questions. The image that I had pained in our heads is very far from the product that was delivered. Everything is clean and Functional but the environment is far from being homelike since there are no proper common area. We came here to work all together and that 16 people table with windows that open is better then a 8 person table in a secluded no air room and it makes it impossible to do what we came to do here. Wish I knew we would have booked something else."
-1,"The welcoming wasn't so good. The room was not like it seemed in the picture. It's so tiny that we just couldn't move. We had booked for two persons and the bed was only 1,40m large ! 
There was also a bad surprise and not noticed in the ad : we had to give 100€ guarantee for the keys and she didn't want to give us the key even we've gave her the money a little later. 
It's not a real B&B. Agnes told us that we weren't allowed to kook in the kitchen but only make coffee or tea. It's not the way for a proper B&B. There was an old rotting chicken in the fridge that was so smelly that we threw it in the garbage. And then Agnes said that we stealed the food !
The worst thing is the bathroom : Agnes put some chlore all around the bath & it was suffocating because she didn't rinsed it. The bathroom is old, wet, the water is often lukewarm and the sink was clogged (very awful !).
Actually I made a mistake the second day : i smoked in the kitchen. So we had a discussion about it and i apologized for me it was clear and closed. But Agnes send me some threatening messages and she contacted B&B after that. I think it was not nice. I took my responsability and she overreacted. 
If you look at Price/quality report, this place is VERY expensive. 90€/day for this ? I ve a friend in Amstedram who told us that with this price we could have afford an hotel with breakfast included.
So the experience was quite bad. But there are some positive things (see below)."
1,"Frisco’s houseboat is a home away from home - so comfortable and inviting. It is on a quiet canal but a quick, easy walk to a variety of stores and restaurants. We were delighted with the accommodations."
1,"Our stay at Gyuszi’s place was great! He was there to great us, explained everything to us regarding his cabin and gave us some tips. As opposed to most places that you share an apartment with a host, you are in a cabin in the garden behind the house. This was both nice for privacy but also bad because you don’t have access to a decent kitchen. That was our own fault since we didn’t read properly when booking.

The cabin itself is cute, clean and the bed is really comfortable. It’s very small. I didn’t really like the bathroom/shower because it stunk of humidity. So it’s basically a small room that’s waterproofed where you shower and also use the toilet. Personally as a clean freak, even if I left the fan continually open, it still smelled awful and I dreaded showering and using the toilet. 

Gyuszi as a host was great and even contacted us to check that everything was good. Thank you so much!"
-1,"Unfortunately this was my first negative airbnb experience. The following aspects/ situations made it so:
-A couple of days prior to check in (for a 3 night stay), my host told me I couldn't check in until 7 pm, which seemed quite late to me, but I rolled with it. The morning of check in day he told me he actually wouldn't be home until 9 pm.
-Upon arrival the host was nice and showed me the room. The apartment appeared to be a fairly large space but all rooms had doors, and I was not shown any rooms behind the doors besides the bedroom and bathroom. So I didn't feel overly welcome.
-The sheets on the bed did not appear clean; I picked off hairs and other weird bits.
-The host told me he worked from home, was ""always home"", so keys were not necessary.
-The next morning (in his underwear) he told me he would be gone that evening from 6 pm - 1 am, so ""how should we manage with keys?"". I didn't feel it was my responsibility to manage the logistics of the situation and asked if he could make a spare for me which I could pick up before he left for the evening. He told me he would try and would message me later in the day.
-By the time he messaged me (6 pm that day) he had already left the apartment and left me instructions to pick up keys from a neighbor.
-I decided the host was not fulfilling his responsibilities and I took my stuff and left. I requested a refund through airbnb for the amount of the two nights I didn't stay there, and the hefty cleaning fee which didn't seem fair considering the level of cleanliness. He counter-offered a refund of $1. Eventually airbnb refunded me the amount I requested (from their own funds) after I submitted photos of the dirty sheets and a very detailed description of the situation.

A nice guy who simply isn't prepared to host well. A cheap place with ""no service"" is fine, but easy access to the space and cleanliness is the bare minimum."
-1,"I have to say that this was a very disappointing listing. I barely know my host as I talked to them 3 times: in my check in, to ask them to make less noise at 11:30pm and on my check out. They would carefully close the door behind us as to make sure we wouldn't see their living room. I am not sure if they had a bad experience in the past or what but this was weird. It seems like they rent this place just for the money, it has the minimum cleanness acceptable and the minimum social interaction necessary.  
When you book there's no room at all and when you get there they come with a whole bunch of rules that are not described in the listing, including ""don't tell anyone you are arbnbing because we are not supposed to rent as one"" Also one of our days we had to ask them to keep the noise down because we couldn't sleep.
The wall are super thin, you can hear when anyone breathes. "
-1,"I would not recommend this apartment. We arrived and there were no cups or silverware. We were not able to drink or eat in the apartment. Later that night when we arrived, We were locked outside of the apartment for over 20 minutes at 11 pm when just arriving in this country for the first time ever and couldn't get in. The key wouldn't open the door. We were not able to get in touch with the owner for assistance and had family in the states help contact them. The response I got from the owner is that the key is tricky. While going to sleep the blanket provided was dirty and had what appeared to be dried up blood. Nothing was offered that day just a message we will come tomorrow in the afternoon and get you silverware and cups. We couldn't get the air conditioning to work either, couldn't eat the groceries we purchased so at that point we decided to leave and go to a hotel. No return call or email from the owner the next day to help us get anything either. Again, it was only family from the United States that was able to get in contact with them via email but by that time we had to go somewhere that we could eat, drink and sleep. 
"
1,I spent some wonderful days at Mirjams place. I felt very welcome and at home. Mirjam is such a kind host and was helping me in any questions. It is easy to get in the city by bus and it was much fun to go by bike and with the ferry with Mirjam into the center of Amsterdam. To come back into this peaceful and green place  in the evening was really good and I enjoyed a lot to spend the morning on the nice balcony in the morning sun. I would definitly come back and can recommend Mirjams place to anybody. 
-1,"Unfortunately we had a very BAD experience staying with Cornelio first and foremost because he stayed on the sofa in the living room (a communal room with no door) for the whole of our stay as he has double-booked his room! This means 6 people on one bathroom! Furthermore, he was not willing to even apologise for his mistake and did not understand 'what our problem was' with him staying in the communal area that we could therefore not use. 

Even before our arrival, Cornelio was not answering our messages up to two days before our arrival; when we arrived we had to wait for 2 hours outside with our luggage until we were able to get hold of the key and enter the room with the unpleasant surprise we had of him double booking the apartment. 

We were very disappointed with the host in terms of basic information we think any host should provide and that is who else will be staying in the flat!

"
0,"The apartment isn't too far from the centre and the room is decent enough. João is also super nice and he was pretty helpful. The only problem really was that the loo was awfully smelly. Not dirty, just awfully smelly."
1,"Sunny and the gang are awesome!  They were so welcoming and the room is relaxing and spacious.  I fell in a god awful nasty pond at 2am (sober mind you) and they were so sweet to wash my clothes and help me out (pond kept my phone).  They made me breakfast, coffees, sandwiches for the road- they were definitely the best people to be with while hitting a low point in my trip!    

Thanks for everything guys!"
0,"Easy location for access to the city. Didn't realize other people were staying there as well in addition to host, who slept on couch. No problem, just weird not to know. Small bed, fine, but a bit uncomfortable. Not cleanest bathrooms but nothing awful. Azir was nice and accommodating and had great communication."
1,"Andrea just started with her airb&b and she was a
perfect host! She let us in with a big smile and we enjoyed eating  some dinner with her on the first evening. The room was big and beautiful too. We had a great time!"
1,Cozy but upscale in a great location! Great hosts (including Jack!) and such a nice stay.
-1,"Unfortunately, we've had a very bad experience. The house is completely disappointed us. Immediately after that examination we left it and went to live in the hotel. The pictures on the website and the impression is completely not consistent with each other. Also present were the terrible smell, which completely eliminated the possibility of our stay there."
1,"Andreas place is very beautiful, nice style, clean and big. She is an amazing host, very friendly and helpful and interested in that her guests are well. I certainly can recomend her place to everybody."
0,"Great location, amazing place. Nice and comfortable app, even better looking than in pictures. Very nice balcony 
The bad thing is that bed&pillows are terrible . Bed is too soft and we had back-aches from it, and the pillows are old and awful."
1,"Marinus' place was easily located right off a few tram and bus lines that got us around the city very easily. My mother had a little difficulty getting up the strais to the front door, but amsterdam in general has narrow stairs. Everything was exactly as expected. "
-1,"I had a bad experience at this appartment. Bed was not fixed by host(I was told that it is fixed but it wasn't). Wifi was not working, told me that it will start working within 1 hour but disappointed only. I feel like I paid more for this, it is not worth what you paid for. Will not recommend to anyone."
-1,"Honestly, I wish I had good things to say about this place, but I just don't. We read plenty of reviews saying this was a great place but we were surely disappointed. First the directions we got were pretty poor and we had an awful time finding the place. Once we figured it out it wasn't too bad but the apartment is way far from the city so expect to pay at least another 50 euros in metro and taxi fees. The room said it would fit 3 but it was barely big enough for the 2 of us. The Windows got left open during the day so every time we came back it was freezing and their were bugs everywhere. I woke up every morning with a fresh batch of bug bites. The guy who we ""checked in"" with was nice but very scattered. He didn't show us anything in the apartment and left without giving us the keys. The host doesn't stay in this apartment so they aren't around to ask questions and are hard to get in contact with and we were looking forward to meeting some local Dutch people to tell us about the city. We didn't really feel safe in this area. A bunch of loud bangs went off our first night (apparently they were just fireworks or something but still pretty scary). You share the apartment with a stranger which I don't mind but the door to your room doesn't lock so we felt all our stuff was unsafe. Also just the little things were annoying - the sink didn't have hand soap and I'm pretty sure the stove was broken (we tried for half an hour to get it turn on with no success). Anyways, the bed was comfy and the shower was decent but honestly, for this price, just go get a hotel or something instead. "
1,"Carolinas place is super nice! We had our own room with an own entrance and a little garden just in front. Unfortunately we didn't see Carolina very often because she was working during the day, but in the evening she could give us a lot of nice insider tips of where to go in Amsterdam. Her appartement is a little bit outside of the city centre, but it was very easy to go to the centre and it didn't take very long. I really can recommend her place to other people!"
1,Great top deck with view out over rooftops. Wonderful location near a park with fantastic facilities for kids (including splash pool area). Amos is also very helpful on the local tips
0,"Comfortable for 3 people.
Location is good if you like to use public transportation. 
The listing has a lot of potential but is still quite new.
The owner employs an ""airbnb team"".
We had a bad experience with the ""airbnb team""."
-1,"Well, this is the biggest disappointment of 2018. The apartment was absolutely disgusting! Everything was dirty, the sheets were looking and smelling awful, the shower was not working ( we had only hot water, but it was nearly boiling, so how were we suppose to have a shower?). In our last day, we had to go to a hotel because .. you can imagine how we were looking after 2 days with no shower. Disgusting! This is the best word to describe how we’ve felt there.
I DO NOT recommend to anyone!"
1,"Gorgeous area, cool running paths nearby. 3 minute walk to the Metro, and 20 minute ride to the Amsterdam Central station. Andrea is very helpful and accommodating. "
1,"Serkan and Gozde were absolutely helpful during my stay in Amsterdam. Serkan kept in touch with me during my arrival at the airport to help me take the quickest way to get to the apartment, and Gozde was there to welcome me and show me around. The location is AMAZING. The house is right on Lindengracht, a beautiful avenue in Jordaan, the most beautiful neighborhood in Amsterdam. Anytime I looked for the nicest places to visit, they usually were around the corner, or right in the middle of the street. Cafe Thijssen, Cafe Papeneiland, Winkel 43.. Great places that were just next to me. On Sunday there's the big weekly market right in front, where you can buy artisanal Dutch cheese, sweets and flowers among other things. All in all a wonderful experience that I can't wait to live again. "
1,"We really enjoyed staying with Carolina. When we first arrived in Amsterdam she gave us great directions to her house and was very communicative in the days leading up to our stay. The apartment itself was great as well -- very clean, plenty of privacy, a nice shared living space, and a lovely private garden. It's in a nice location, about 20 minutes from the center of Amsterdam, and Carolina helped to make sure we understood all the public transportation that could take us there. We had a great stay! "
-1,"The place is not even worth half of the price. It’s not clean,  very noisy and smells like cat shit. 

I understand that smoking is allowed in the apartment but the whole place smells like an ash tray. The host and his guests were very loud almost all day everyday. 

I woke up to the host’s girlfriend knocking on the door one hour before my check out time to kick me out. It was a bad experience and I highly don’t recommend it to anyone else. Check my profile and before ratings. This is my first negative review on Airbnb."
-1,"This place is absolutely not what it looks like on the pictures. It was dirty, the location was not so great and the room was uncomfortable. Sandra is a very kind woman and the communication was very good, but the apartment was totally not what we expected it to be. We certainly do not recommend this place"
1,"Kevins place is unique, quirky and well equipped. Our teenage girls especially loved it. Kevin and his mother were friendly and informative hosts. The area is very pleasent with a windmill and canal on the doorstep. Close to a supermarket. The tram was easy to get to in 10 to 15 minutes walking time. Good value for money."
-1,"First off let me say this is a lovely apartment. Perfect for a weekend break....but don't let this sway you into staying here!!!

The host(s) are not at all helpful. Firstly, we were left for an hour waiting for the keys after giving ample notice of when we would arrive. When we contacted the host to enquire about which tram to get from central station we were told its too hard and just to get a taxi. When the host finally met us, it was ""Sammy"" but not the guy in the picture. I am sure this is an agency let apartment...

""Sammy"" then brought us up to the apartment, quite hastily showed us around. He then asked me to sign a form and took a photograph of my passport should any damages to the apartment occur.

Just after ""sammy"" left, I noticed the blind on the main window in the living room was broken . I tried to call to note this but my call was not answered so I text this problem to note it... And lucky I did...

After our departure, I received a request for €150 and a message saying the request was for the broken blind. I declined and stated that the blind was broken before our arrival and I had said this to the host. I got a reply to this saying thanks Audrey this makes sense. Now I don't know who Audrey is or who broke the blind but I do not like the fact I was accused in the wrong. We left the apartment as clean as when we arrived and caused no damage whatsoever. 

Furthermore, checkout time was 11am... The cleaner came to the apartment at 10am... One hour before checkout time!!!


If you are staying here, make sure you do not get scammed... Like we nearly did!!!"
0,"If you want adequate shelter in a good location, this place is ideal. If you want something homey and charming, look elsewhere. This was basically an adequate hotel, with signs everywhere reminding guests to respect the neighbours. They've probably had bad experiences with guests in the past, but to me and my family, it felt unwelcoming. That said, the beds were clean and comfortable.

There are cafés and restaurants just down the street.
Peter was hospitable and helpful to manage with our plane tickets problem.
However, I was a bit disappointed at the beginning because, from the website, I thought it was a large room with the view on the canal, with a private bathroom and the room opens on a back-yard and the shower is in the room (as we can actually see on the photograph) I know it's a bit contradictory but....
I would nevertherless recomand the place because it is clean and really ideally situated, and Peter was very obliging"
-1,"Unfortunately this was our first bad experience with Airbnb (after many excellent ones), and sadly our first bad review ever. Our recommendation: do NOT stay in this appartment! Simply DO NOT DO IT! Rental is managed by Lamb&b, so we never saw the actual owner. Representative of Lamb&b was late for check-in and didn't know anything. Biggest issue: the appartment was dirty, really dirty when we arrived. The appartment simply wasn't cleaned. With 'dirty' I mean: staircase that hasn't seen a brush (let alone water) in the past 6 months. Used and dirty towels of other people in the sofa. A dirty sink with used tea bags in it. Used and dirty sheets on the bed. Dirty toilet, shower, and sink in the bathroom. We'll spare you the details... A huge terrace (a rarity in Amsterdam) that could have been great, but that we couldn't use because is was that much neglected that we couldn't walk or sit on it. Mold on the wooden floor and on the cushions of the furniture. Instead of admitting that the appartment wasn't cleaned, the representative started to change the sheets of the bed himself, quickly threw the tea bags in the bin, took the dirty towels and shoved them aside and told us 'now you have a clean bed'. We actually thought that we were on candid camera...  If I wasn't 8 months pregnant, I would have preferred sleeping in my car - not kidding. Unfortunately there wasn't another accommodation available, a long and sunny weekend so everything fully booked in Amsterdam. With no other option available, both my husband and I insisted on having a clean appartment. By the evening the appartment was more or less 'cleaned' superficially. Better than what is was before, but still no change in the situation of the staircase or the terrace. On top of that we had a 'surprise visitor' on Saturday night. Around 01h00 at night a male individual arrived at our door. He tried to open it, but luckily we left the key on it, so he couldn't get in. A lot of noise, stumbeling and then after a while he gave up and fell asleep against our door. Then he started snoring, loudly and non stop, 3 meters away from where we were sleeping. This continued until 6 am and then he disappeared... We actually considered calling security, but didn't do it in the end because we didn't want to ruin our weekend getaway by spending quality time with the police. If you know that we spent 423 € for 2 nights in this place, you can imagine how happy we were... Our advice: DO NOT BOOK THIS APPARTMENT. By writing this review, we hope to prevent other travellers from making the same -huge- mistake. "
1,"The location of the boat was fantastic. Close walking distance to Central Train station and the central city area. I will say that although there are three beds, I would not recommend more than two people staying here as it would be cramped. The dock facilities were really good and even the boat shower was good for a quick shower if necessary. I would recommend anyone staying there especially during the warmer months. "
1,"In several years and over 20 different airbnb places I've stayed at, my experience at Sonia's has been the absolute best so far! It's a beautiful and spotless apartment in a good neighborhood close to everything, but not in the godawful most central and touristy part of Amsterdam. The area is full of nice restaurants and cafes, walking distance to Vondelpark and the museum district. The apartment is dead quiet and full of light, with huge windows looking out onto a very green back garden area with many cats. The apartment has fast internet, a wonderfully equipped kitchen and a luxurious bedroom with skylights and big soaking tub. Unlike many Amsterdam cute places where quirky and cool also means mice and grime, the apartment was spotless."
1,Akon’s home was perfectly located and I loved the space! It’s close to the center which is about 10 min walk and there’s tons of cafes and restaurants near his place. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would love to stay again.
1,"Outstanding location! Comfy and clean. 
Only negatives to note are to be aware that the address given is the meet-up point with the host -  NOT the home, and that you can hear the people living underneath quite loudly at times."
1,The Beaufort is a beautiful ship and it was a unforgettable experience to sleep on a houseboat. We loved it! The room is cozy and very modern. Joost (a friend of Erik&Margriet) was very friendly and helpful!
1,"The apartment was exactly how it looks in the photos nice light spacious with a lovely balcony, angelique was there to welcome us when we arrived, a very warm friendly person with lots of suggestions of what was going on in the city at that time. The neighbourhood was lovely turning right your into the busier tram lines and shops area and turning left into the quieter canal streets to wander. Very close walk to Jordann and Nine Streets area where we spent most of our time in little restaurants/cafés and smaller unique shops. Overall a great stay apartment and host our only disappointment was the bed was slightly uncomftable, but saying that we would still stay again."
1,Compact & comfortable base in a lively area not far from the centre & close with plenty of bars & cafes nearby.  Comfy double bed & Nespresso machine were nice touches.  Recommended!
1,"My friend and I loved Louis’ place. Although Amsterdam itself is rather expensive, this location offers great value for money and is centrally located. Although in the red light district, the room itself is quiet and we never found ourselves struggling to sleep. In fact, the only complaint we have is that the bed is awfully comfortable and impossible to leave in the morning! Would definitely recommend staying here if you’re planning on doing most of your visit on foot and/or are looking for a kind and welcoming host."
1,"The room is great and clean! Miek and Willem are very nice that they gave many suggestions to us and answered all our questions. It takes around 7 minutes to walk to the train station and tram station. The path is quite easy so it is very convenient for us.
There are many facilities in the house. I lived there for four nights and I cook for dinner every night.  
If I have time to travel to amsterdam again, I will surely come to this house again!"
1,"We didn't meet Thea, but her mother welcomed us into their house, situated in a cute neighbourhood outside of Amsterdam. We stayed the night after a concert in the Heineken Music Hall, which is a 20-minute walk from the house. The room was nice and hot (thankfully), and we had a good night's rest in the fairly small bed."
1,"Andrea is a great hostess! Her room is big, clean, sweet :) We love it !!!!   
"
1,The apartment was great for our family of 4. Great location with lots to do and see. 
1,"Perfect! Everything was perfect :) Dionne was there helping us and giving us recommendations and tips for the city! Unfortunately we couldn't use the bikes, as the weather was awful, but she kindly offered them! Bed really comfy, toilet clean and really nice! All perfect, deffo would come back!"
0,"Although this place is not too bad, I wouldn't rave about it. It is satisfactory for cheap accom, let's say that. However... No-one was there to let me in, and I had to wait at a nearby cafe for keys to arrive by taxi. The shower was blocked with hair (I had to unblock it). The kitchen is inhabited by a mouse. The view from the room is awful; a vacant block which is a muddy swamp. The bedding is not very good. And the area of Amsterdam is not very nice - I did not feel safe walking around there, although to be fair the other guests had no issue so maybe this was just me. Also, the room is on the 4th floor so I hope you like stairs. Kaya is a man, by the way - not the woman who is shown in the picture."
1,"Great location, walking distance to city center and major transit. Safe neighborhood. Great communication with host."
1,"We stayed for 5 days at Andrea's guests room during January. The room is clean, pleasant and well taken care of and Andrea is very friendly and helpful. We appreciated the privacy we had there too. The location - it is away from the city centre but can easily reached with the metro and bus and certainly a peaceful place to come back to at the end of the day (or in the middle of it)."
-1,"The biggest issue I had with this airbnb was the fact that the pictures show you one apartment, and when you walk in, its a completely different place. Within 10 seconds of being there I thought I had accidentally booked the wrong airbnb but later looked at the pictures and found that it was the same place just with absolutely no life in it at all. I was willing to pay the amount asked from what I saw in the pictures, but it is way over priced for what you actually get. 
There was no wifi available, and was left hanging by the owner & airbnb company for hours before they came back to the apartment with a T-Link 4G Mobile hotspot...
To top it off, the neighbor downstairs was awful & made my girlfriend feel very uncomfortable to stay there with his rude remarks & threatening tone.
On a positive note, the grocery store nearby was great, the yoga spot nearby was amazing, and the park across the street was lovely..."
-1,"Never heard from or saw Frank until I notified that I had left the apartment and moved into a hotel-he then emailed me as my phone crashed on way to apartment. On arrival the apartment stank of pungent cleaning materials. No milk for a cuppa after a long journey. No soap in bathrooms - tail end of used bar of soap which I threw out. Towels were hard & crisp and discoloured - hated having to use them. Toilet mirror old & damaged unable to see reflection. Toothbrush holder and soap tray in bathroom were filthy and rusted. Bed linen not ironed - hated having to use the bed. Broken & old furniture, some chairs actually had holes in them. No comfortable chair to sit & relax on. Balcony roof leaks & it was raining so just awful. No light in the balcony.I left & booked into a hotel as this apartment much to my dissapointment had the potential to ruin my experience of Amsterdam."
-1,"Such a disappointment, mistreat and simply worst experience ever. For the price we paid this is simply unacceptable 
1. Dirty dishes and cups were disgusting. The first thing we had to do is to wash the dishes in order to be able to use them. Very upsetting
2. There were no cutting knives! And there were only available plastic utensils (multiple-use) !!! What is that? Just imagine you have to cut Dutch cheese with a plastic knife! Almost impossible and frustrating. 
3. There was no soap in the bathroom upstairs. This should be so simple and so obvious.... There was no shampoo. The showering gel bottle was dirty and unpleasant to touch. 
4. We were given only one bath towel (for every need or use) for person for 4 days of living. The quality of towels as well as sheets are awful! 
5. Insects. There were insects on the walls. I was so very concerned with the hygiene of this place. 
6. The sink upstairs was clogged and almost impossible to use"
1,"Excellent price, perfect location, very quick, easy communication with host. Had everything we needed, up four steep flight of steps that caused us great amusement with our luggage, very beautiful Amsterdam studio, with added bonus of a balcony, which was scattered in snow one morning. Highly recommend."
-1,"The truth is that David behaved very badly with us, because he made us pay 100 euros more because his ad was a trap has a picture with a double bed but it is really for a single guest. Then the apartment can not use the kitchen because it loses gas which is dangerous. Bathing was impossible, the sheets a disgust, pay 400euros for that really was a scam, what was worth it is the location. David never showed up to talk to us."
1,"Carolina's place is pretty, comfortable and clean. The bed and the pullout are comfortable. The garden in the back is very cute. Carolina herself was very welcoming and kind.

As for location, the flat is in a quiet and cosy neighbourhood. Getting to the centre and back was easy using buses. "
0,"Even if Hamed was super nice, kind and helpful when we arrived. Also, very responsive. I do not think this apartment is good for a baby. The stairs are super narrow and very inclined. I felt very worried when i was about to walk down these stairs with our baby.  Plus the noise was awful during the nights and i know hamed can't do a lot to stop this but we did not sleep at all on friday night. The glass window should be tripled and we should have been awared by Hamed... We bought some earplugs for Saturday nights.. So we were tired when we left amsterdam.. because we haven't sleep enough in this apt. This apt is good for students, people who wants to go out and barely sleep... but not for people who want to sleep during the nights.  "
-1,"We booked this place for 2 nights.  The day before my friend and I were to arrive (we were traveling at the time), Cin texted me saying she had an emergency and had to stay at the place.  She gave us 2 choices: 1) we could stay WITH her the 2 nights, or 2) she would cancel the reservation.  I told her to cancel, but she did not and my account got charged.  

What followed was ~2 weeks of back-and-forth messaging trying to get my money back, during which she asked me for my bank account information.  I refused and sent her the very easy steps to refund me on airbnb website and I never heard back, except for another request for my bank acct information. 

I appealed to airbnb and they were finally able to refund my money.

Certainly not recommended."
-1,"This place is terrible.  I would not recommend to anyone.  It is two flights up a very narrow stairwell and it smells awful.  Literally, awful.  It is right over a Chinese Restaurant, which probably accounts for the smell.  Even opening the windows did not help the situation, especially since it was cold when we were there - the choice was either suffocate with a disgusting aroma or freeze; we chose to freeze.  I am not exaggerating when I say the smell made me gag repeatedly.  The other issue is that, even though we stayed just one night, our son got over 40 bug bites.  We think this must have been bed bugs, as the  other three of us got no bites, except for my daughter who got 3 mosquito bites that were completely different from our son's bites.  We had booked this place for 5 nights but ended up staying just one, due to a passport issue with our children.  In retrospect, I am happy we only stayed one night, as we would have left immediately anyway.  Despite all this, our host offered us nothing as far as reimbursement, so we paid over $2,000 US for one night, a horrible smell, and a bunch of bug bits on our son.  

We ended up staying at a hotel down the street for a couple of nights after, Conscious Hotel Tire Store - much better accommodations, cleanliness, and service."
1,"Stay was good, apartment in great location, host was friendly and helpful. No bad experiences "
1,"Lettie's apartment is spotlessly clean and very comfortable. A perfect base for exploring Amsterdam for a few days. We also hired Jurriaan for the boat trip, which was real treat exploring the canals on a private boat. A brilliant experience."
-1,"SCAM! GO AWAY FROM THIS AIRBNB. 
We were 2 french students, we rent this apartment for 2 months and it was a DISASTER. The host came in the apartment during our absence without warning ! The apartment is very dirty, spider webs and dust EVERYWHERE. 
WE FOUND AN UNDERWEAR UNDER A CURTAIN! The host was discriminant about us because we are students - she don’t take us  with serious, always very nasty and demeaning. 
We lived a nightmare during this 2 months. 
Worst experience..."
1,I have only stayed in one Airbnb before and it was absolutely awful. Booking this Airbnb I was nervous but when I arrived I was extremely pleased with everything that this couple offered. They both were extremely nice and the place was very clean. Great location and they answered all the questions that we had! I highly recommend staying here!
1,"Nice house in quiet part of Amsterdam. Easy access to the city by bus - only 2 minuttes away. The house was clean, nice and cosy. We enjoyed to ""take care of the cat"", which we by the way named Rem. "
-1,"that it is not as it appears in the photos , it is a scam "
0,"Excellent hosts, well organised. A good location, walking distance to main museums and very close to main shopping streets. Plenty of space for us, 2 adults and 2 teenage boys. Comfortable beds, warm, good bathrooms. Recommend the Asian restaurant/takeaway downstairs.
This was listed as an apartment so we were disappointed that no kitchen was included. This would have made it more cost effective as we had planned to self cater for breakfast. May be a problem with how airbnb classifies accommodation.
There was plenty of street noise from people  throughout the night (we were there Thurs to Sat) almost until dawn so it's not a quiet area.
This worked out ok for us but was expensive for just four people given it is limited for self catering. "
-1,"Minou really ruined our stay in Amsterdam. We had booked based on her 5-star reviews, despite the lack of photos. The room itself was charming and the location was very nice, but we were not able to enjoy ourselves because our host was constantly calling and messaging to berate us for our very normal usage of her Airbnb. She did not like us from the moment we arrived. She made us unpack our suitcases before taking anything upstairs and criticized us for even having suitcases (we were four people on a eurotrip, so it was inevitable. There was nothing in the listing to make us believe we should not have bags.) The room itself was very hot when we arrived. We asked her about this and she said there was no AC (which we understood) and that the window could be propped open with a block. She did not tell us that any of the other windows opened or that they could stay open without the block being used. When we tried to open them further and propped it open with a book, she called me and berated me for being so disrespectful. She told us we belonged at a youth hostel and were horrible guests. She also got mad at us for having bottled water when we could’ve drank from the tap, and for pushing “too hard” to open her trash can—all of which she discovered after entering our room without any notice or permission while we were out of the Airbnb having lunch. She removed the book and propped it back open with a block. When I complained to Airbnb about her behavior, she came back and opened all three windows all the way but told us we could not open or close them ourselves because she didn’t trust us to move them ourselves. It would have been nice to know that they opened from the beginning—it was 80 degrees in the apartment when it was only 60 degrees outside. We ended up checking out early and spending twice as much to stay at a hotel last minute because she was so insufferable. I’ve never had such a bad experience with a host in my years of using Airbnb. I would not recommend anyone to stay at her place and I don’t think she should be hosting as she is clearly not okay with people staying in her room for normal use."
-1,"I took my partner to Amsterdam for his 30th birthday weekend but wish I'd saved my money and energy by staying elsewhere. Unfortunately we were let down by the host who despite advising where to find keys and confirming we could drop our bags off after 11am, failed to leave keys, acknowledge our arrival or even ensure the apartment was empty and clean for our 2pm check in. Instead we arrived at midday only to wait outside in the cold for 2 hours for the cleaner to come & allow us to drop our bags, whilst he cleaned the apartment and waited for the previous guests to take their belongings which they'd left. This resulted in several costly calls to a Deutsch number, zero apology and a rather disrupted first day which is disappointing since we only stayed for the weekend. Due to this 2 hour wait we missed out on the opportunity to see some friends we had arranged to see which for me ruined my entire experience. Additionally, mouse droppings were found in our bed, we heard mice scurrying around throughout the night and one of us almost electrocuted herself on the faulty electrics. No apology was offered, instead I was told by the host ""I can't find the msg where I stated you could drop your bags after 11am"". I screenshot and sent to him but despite that still no apology. Heaven forbid I dare ask for a refund! The host was aware we were there to celebrate a birthday & instead of making a small effort to enhance our stay, he did the opposite and despite me alerting him to this fact he doesn't have the decency to apologise, let alone make it up to us. "
1,"Top notch. A-1. I can't say enough great things about this place and the host. 
The kitchen is awesome. Everything you need to cook as if you were at home. Plenty of pots and pans, utensils, silverware, a dishwasher, 2 coffee machines(though I wish there was a french press) and a 4 burner gas stove/oven. A joy to prepare a meal here. 

The location is great if you don't mind being a bit far from the city. We choose it for that reason, we tourists wanted to be away from tourists! I visit Amsterdam twice a year, always using Airbnb and Martijn's place is the best I've had. The neighborhood has all you need in terms of supermarkets and such. Also a great coffee shop nearby, The Stud, if you're into such things. Being 4-5 kilometers from the city was not a big deal for us. We'd walk that in one direction and maybe grab an Uber coming back home. 

The bed was comfortable and the wardrobe in the bedroom has lots of space for your clothes. The shower was excellent, plenty of hot water. Not a fancy shower but solid water pressure. There is a washing machine too but man are they slow in Netherlands. Takes what seems like forever to do a wash. But that wasn't an issue at all. 

Living room has a flat screen tv and enough channels in English to zone out for a bit and enjoy some Comedy Channel reruns of South Park, American Dad, How I Met Your Mother etc. We didn't spend a ton of time watching but good to know the option exists. Big table that seats 4 comfortably for eating or playing cards/games etc. The one small thing in the tv/dining room would be the lighting. Tough to read in that room, just not bright enough. A small thing but one I thought worth mentioning. The heating is great here too. Very responsive thermostat. 

The host is great. Super friendly and super responsive. We lost power our second night and he offered to come address it that night, a Friday, even though his commute to us would be awful. We opted to be without for the night and he was there the next morning. He's respectful of his guests and was hesitant to enter his own place while we were renting. Honestly, I can't say enough good things about him and his pace. RENT HERE and live like a local for at least part of your stay. The canals are only a few kilometers away!

Thanks Martijn!!!

David"
1,"We knew this was going to be a great place to stay, but it ended up being even better! 

This was our first time in Amsterdam so we didn't really know what we were doing. Caroline was extremely helpful and responsive to our many questions (she even saved us from a scammy website when we were trying to figure out the trains before our trip).  

The boat is perfect for two people and I can't imagine a better location: on a quiet canal a short walk from Amsterdam Centraal and steps away from the action and food.  You can easily check out the excitement and crowds of the red light district and then retreat to your private boat without having to rent a bike or find other transportation.  

Another nice touch is that the boat is stocked with cooking essentials so you don't need to worry about picking up every condiment or spice if you plan on cooking a meal or two (hopefully Caroline didn't mind us using some of her Nutella on our waffles!). 

In summary: highly recommended :)"
-1,"The apartment was really really dirty, the bed sheets even more dirty, no clean towels, actually dirty  all around, kitchen with dirty dishes in the sink.  Awful stay!!!you should pay me back for the cleaning that I done! Hope you enjoyed your holiday. Thank you very much!"
1,"Sofiane was very helpful and kind. He had a folder full of tourist information including maps, which he went over with me even at the awful late hour I arrived at his place. He also had lots of useful information about the city and its attractions - he knew how long the que is for attractions and gave alternate options/advice. The museum card rental for 10 euros per day was brilliant!!

The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and as a solo female traveler, I felt safe. There is a sink in the room which I thought was convenient. Also liked the no shoes policy as the place is kept clean. It was cold in late September and I get cold easily, but the place was warm and I had no problem getting a full night's rest.

Overall, a positive airbnb experience. Would recommend."
1,We loved the place. On a quiet street but still close to the action. The hosts were fantastic!
1,"Maybe it is a bit away from the center, but close-by there is a metro station, as well as bus stations taking you quite fast to the center. The house is simple, but clean. The bed is soft and I had a great sleep there. Also, the check-in was flexible, my flight got delayed and I communicated quite efficiently with Gregory, so it turned out to be just fine. No bad experiences, I recommend."
1,"Location, Location, Location!
This house is simply fabulous, largely because of its central location. It is literally 5 minutes from the Dam, and close to many bars and restaurants of every kind, including a Michelin starred restaurant, The Bridge.
I arrived 3 hours later than planned, but this wasn't an issue - I was met by Emilio, an agent, who showed me the basics and gave me a pack of delicious stroopwaffels.
The house itself covers 4 levels, and comprises the kitchen/diner -  well equipped and spotlessly clean - up  a level to the sitting room, with a large flat-screen tv and large sofa - up again to the first bedroom and the bathroom, then up again to the other bedroom.
There is even a small table and 2 chairs on the roof, so if the weather is good, you can sit outside and look over the rooftops of Amsterdam.........
The only issue was the house next door is being renovated, so there was an awful lot of noise starting at 7:30 - and the hosts had made this very clear before I booked it, so it really wasn't a big deal.... 
I thought the whole place was terrific, and will certainly look to stay there again if I ever need to go back to Amsterdam."
-1,"the service of this  boat was very disappointing:
1) the toilet was broken from the first time, the vibration of the boat after de rain has screwball the handle's support
2) we don't haved the light of the boat and the water, because "" the battery havenìt charge, but this thing isn't specificate in the insersion.
3) the boat was really dirty, dirty blankes and expired food in the cupboards.

Bad experience."
1,"Great little studio, in a nice neighborhood of Amsterdam. Located near the park so the evenings were quiet. Public transportation is close by and makes getting around very easy. Hosts are very accommodating yet also give you your space and privacy. Would stay here again. "
-1,"The hosts are extremely friendly and accommodating. We found the apartment disappointing though. The pictures and description do not accurately reflect the condition or layout.

The apartment came across as a low budget student apartment.

Bed and pillows are very uncomfortable. Bedding + Towels - low quality and multi-coloured. My opinion is the only acceptable bedding and towels are white. Especially for guest accommodations - anything else makes one question whether they are clean.

When you first enter the apartment you are subjected to heavy cigarette smoke. Fortunately you could not smell smoke in the apartment.

In front of sink in bathroom was a large uninstalled tile that rocked back and forth hiding a damaged floor. On top of this was a dark coloured floor matt.

Baseboards are missing in apartment - it appears as though they were removed to accommodate repairs but never got replaced exposing the damaged walls. Walls need a new coat of paint.

The overall apartment needs a thorough cleaning and cosmetic upgrades.

With a few changes this could be a great place to stay."
1,"The apartment has the best location in town. We havent see sammy because always his friends answered to our calls. Except that we were waiting outside the building one hour at the check in , everything was excellent. Good apartment ! "
1,"Oana & Andrey have an amazing flat in a fantastic part of Amsterdam. Oana was a lovely host, she made my partner and I feel very welcome. The room is a good size for two people, the rooftop terrace seems like a perfect area to relax, unfortunately we had awful weather for our trip. 

I would really recommend the room for a couple, it is a fantastic alternative to the expensive Amsterdam hostels, if you are going to Amsterdam, stay here. 

"
-1,"I've never had a problem with a reservation made through Airbnb but this is my first bad experience. Usually when something is not working the host will correct the problem in a day or two. Not this time. Host was there when I arrived(Saturday) and said the previous guest had broken the internet and TV service and would be making a claim against them to pay for it. I explained to her that it was important to have internet access as I do my business online and also use Skype for my phone when traveling. It's also nice to have TV for news and entertainment when in a new city. Said she would have it turned back on the next day and that she would stop by Sunday evening at 9pm to check and make sure it was working. I said I would email her as soon as it came back on so she would know that the service working. She did not show up Sunday evening and the service did not come back on. Evidently, the TVand internet come from the same provider. I borrowed someone's phone and called her a couple days later to tell her it still was not working. Her response was that things are done slowly in Amsterdam and they are working on it. I asked for the name of the service provider so I could coordinate with them but she refused. Said she could offer me phone service(but no phone) instead. No, I need internet and TV since that is what I paid for. Also let her know there were several light bulbs out and need replacements as the place is dimly lit. A couple days more I called again and she said the provider had made errors and was correcting it. I finally went to the library(two miles away in the city center) to use their computers and emailed her several times that it still was not working. Never heard from her until I emailed that I would be requesting a refund, then she responded the very next day saying she was out of the country and didn't know the internet and TV were not fixed and would call them the next day. Never heard from her again. Still no internet or TV!!(or light bulbs) I could have looked for another apartment but there is no guarantee of getting a refund and I didn't think I should have to pay for two apartments. Had this host been honest from day one and said there is no TV or internet I could have moved then but I believed her story. In the entire month, the host never once checked back to see if everything was OK, showed no concern whatsoever. The apartment itself is OK. Not in a very nice part of town but there are three locks on the door. There are not many restaurants in this area either. I would suggest finding an apartment closer to the center where restaurants and museums..."
-1,"Mouse droppings EVERYWHERE and Elena (the host) will simply insult you and act as if it is normal...I can tell you that rat droppings next to the bed, in the kitchen, in the living room AND bathroom are not normal in any city unless your building is infested..

I'm sure they've had this issue before with guest as the host and manager seems to have their little act together to scam people out of their stay...They know exactly how to delay until you leave as to prevent providing sanitary accommodation or refunds... Our vacation was interrupted because of the mice AND the manager coming to ""inspect"" as if we were lying.. The 'manager' left SUPER grossed out at the amount of mice droppings - only to interrupt our stay again with an (URL HIDDEN) 

We are having a very hard time with Airbnb's support and the terrible host even though we've provided evidence of our destroyed belongings (mice chewed threw some documents and personal items) and of all the mouse droppings around the (URL HIDDEN) per Airbnb Policy, animals in the apartment (especially vermin) are against the terms of service.. My entire group of 3 regrets staying here. 

I do NOT recommend staying here unless you're looking to get Hantavirus or something from a vermin infestation..

The towels provided were extremely dirty so we had to buy our own, windows don't close well in the bathroom, no shower curtain, and the bed is EXTREMELY noisy/uncomfortable. 

Worst Airbnb experience I've ever had."
1,Apartment was nice and is right by a tram stop which makes it very easy to get around central Amsterdam. 
-1,"As described in the other parts of my review, I was extremely disappointed in the following aspects of our stay.

1. we arrived to find that there were not 2 double beds and 2 single beds as advertised (and confirmed by the host in email correspondence), but 1 double bed and 3 single (child size) beds. We had 6 guests so this meant my husband and I slept on the sofa. We were told that the cleaner would be coming an hour or so after we arrived and that he or she would make up both sofas and leave enough towels. We had to leave as we were already late (sorting out the bedding issues over the phone) to meet a friend, so the person who met us said he'd stay and ensure the cleaner made up both beds and left enough towels. Only one sofa was made up and we had to scrounge around and use old sheets from a cupboard for the other sofa. There were not enough towels either. The ""pillow"" I had was two small sofa cushions stuffed into a pillow case. It felt like I was a student crashing on a friends' sofa (not the experience we were going for, nor what we paid for).
2. On our last day we were due to check out at 11am, the cleaner arrived at 8.30am and let herself in. It took several phone calls and about half an hour to arrange for her to go and come back after we'd left (during which time she went upstairs and into the bedroom of a sleeping guest - waking him up).
3. Our email and phone correspondence with the ""host"" (this property is actually let through a company called House2Home) was frustrating and at the time of writing this review (more than a week after our stay) we still have not resolved the question of a refund to address all these issues. 
4. I spent 30-60 mins on our first day, and again on our last day (we were only there for 2 nights) on the phone/emailing trying to sort out these issues. As you can imagine, this compounded the bedding, linen, and cleaner issues and made for a most dissatisfying Airbnb experience. 

I am pleased to say, however, that this is the only bad experience I have had with Airbnb and I will continue to use it for other cities and lettings. "
1,We spent a great time! Very nice i recommended it! Thank you again for everything! 
-1,"I am writing in relation to my experience of staying at Amsterdamiss's place from 1st-2nd June 2013 which was quite unpleasant and affected our holiday as a result. First of all, Amsterdamiss's place was cluttered with a lot of her own used and old items and furniture. As soon as we entered into the door, there were many pairs of old shoes stacking up beside the door. When we entered into the private room (it was not a private room as the door could not be locked and the door was made of glass), the place was filled up by her personal belongings, we did not have real beds to sleep on, just two folded beds. We had no cupboards or whatsoever to hang our clothes. At night, there are only two desk lamps available for the illumination of the room; this includes one desk lamp which only lights on from 8-11pm. So, you could not do anything in the room except sleeping in the evening. Secondly, Amsterdamiss had asked us to use her kitchen facilities freely. However, her kitchen was also cluttered with all her stuff. When you wash and clean something in the basin, you cannot put it anywhere on the kitchen table as it was full of empty containers. If you want to use the stove (there were a total of 4 hobs), you will find on top of two hobs, there were vegetables and fruits stacked on them, another two hobs had used and dirty pots and pans. Thirdly, when we wanted to take a shower in the evening, the place of shower would become flooded for some reasons. Around her wash basin in the bathroom, there was a big bag filled with used cotton buds (some with blood). Lastly, on the evening of 1st June 2013, when my mum and I were trying to get back to her house after a day out, we found that the door could be unlocked after a several attempts. We called Amsterdamiss a few times and received no response. Feeling cold and hungry, we went to a nearby Kebab house to have our dinner. While having our dinner, we texted her and she just asked us to keep trying and when asked what time she will be back, she said she was not sure about that. (I understand that she needed to work on that night). After finishing our dinner at around 10pm, we decided to try again and luckily this time we managed to unlock the door, or else we would need to wait until Amsterdamiss finished her job and back home. I wonder if Airbnb has any action in response to my feedback as I feel it was like a total scam or some kind of trap for foreigners to step in. Besides, I feel that Amsterdamiss was not being honest on the conditions of her house and she has posted photos which are misleading in her advertisement. I am writing all this to prevent people to..."
-1,"Our host, Yelle arrived to let us into the flat shortly after phoning him. All communications before and during were smooth with prompt responses from the hosts. Yelle was really helpful with storing our bags for us on our last day.
The location is perfect for exploring the Jordaan district and all points north, south and west in the City. Lovely narrow streets and canals with plenty of bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants to choose from right on the doorstep and within a pleasant stroll. 

However, overall we were very disappointed with the space. The initial first impression was a dark, dirty narrow hallway and filthy staircase. This led to a bright clean space with great views over the pretty canals but on closer inspection we found it to be very poor. 
The sofa was covered in stains, the kettle only boiled if you kept the switch down manually - or by using the weight of the breadboard - but only when we weren't using the breadboard to prop open one of the three sash windows!
One good point was that the bed was really comfortable, however, what storage space there was in the bedroom was filled with spare bedding which alas did not include spare pillows, as the only two provided were very thin and flimsy (as were the towels) so we made do with a spare quilt underneath. An important point to mention is that the bathroom is off the living room so you have to go downstairs during the night if you need the loo - doubly awkward if the sofa-bed is in use! No blinds on the velux windows in the bedroom so little chance for a lie in.  
Overall not a good experience, poor value for money and plenty of room for improvement. A small amount of attention to detail could make it perfect."
1,"Miranda and Paul were amazing hosts! They were always very helpful, informative, and couldn't have done more for us during our stay. The breakfast they provided was always delicious, and included local Dutch cuisine, which was great!

Their home is warm and comfortable, and in a lovely small village fairly close to the centre of Amsterdam. We'd definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it to anyone! "
-1,"Location was really good. Close to the centre. But we were disappointed with this flat. The first and the main reason is the toilet which was broken and as we understood it's not for the first time. So it was really awful and etc. Also we got a huge stress when on the first day we came back to this flat at 11 pm and couldn't open the front door. We called Nick for a help and he didn't answer maybe because of the late hour. But we were forced to wake up some neighbor to open a door for us. On the next day we  learnt from Nick that there is a special way for opening that door but unfortunately we were not warned about it in the beginning. And there is a lot of stuff of the host (as even for example underwear under the bed) which is not nice as well. It's not the first time we stay in the airbnb flat. And this time was the worst one. There are a lot of interesting books and a guitar, the view is nice but anyway I wouldn't recommend this flat to anyone. 
Квартира недалеко от основных достопримечательностей, но не уютная, повсюду вещи хозяина. И самое главное - там был забит унитаз. Причем, как мы поняли -не в первый раз. В общем, впечатления не самые приятные. И добавило стресса то, что когда мы вернулись домой в первый день в 11 вечера, то не смогли открыть основную дверь дома, Ник трубку не брал и нам пришлось будить соседей для того, чтобы попасть в дом. На след день Ник рассказал, что для открывания этой двери есть специальный способ ""подергать вверх-вниз и потянуть""))) к сожалению, мы до него не додумались и так и не поняли, почему нельзя было предупредить об этом заранее. В общем, супер бюджетный вариант, один из случаев, когда экономия не затмевает собой все недостатки.  "
1,"The apartment was so nice and comfortable, top quality/price ratio. We were three guys in Amsterdam on holiday, the bus stop was at 100 meters and it has been so easy to get in town; we also managed to cook all our lunches and dinners so we saved a lot of money (there are two supermarkets in 500 meters)! The tv doesn't get the connection, but it was irrelevant. Really hope to stay there if we'd come again! Thank you so much!"
-1,"Biggest scam ever.  Turn away.
Turn away."
-1,"Before I rent the apartment, i've read all the reviews and knew that the apartment is always noisy in the midnight but did not expect it would last that long (till 5am). 

The owner of the house did not refer about the guy who I supposed to meet instead of her (owner), and did not give me his phone number. Then I called the phone number that shown in the itinerary on the day I arrived , called many times but nobody picked up the phone. To be honest, there are 2 phone numbers there and one of them is wrong number, which I received a call from that number and got yelled. Whole my family was waiting the owner on the street because she did not give me the house number. Air was quite cold with 4 big luggages beside. Then more than 1hr later, finally she picked up her phone.....

After that, I sent her a message to ask what happened on that day and how awful was that and 2 days after I got her response which was ""I dont understand what did u refer abt the messages..."". It was the worse impression and havent receieved a ""sorry"" from the owner. 
Really disappointed.

1,Lovely room in a great area!
1,"I just needed a quiet inexpensive place to stay overnight in Amsterdam and not too far from Amsterdam Central.  I found that private room at Noah’s apartment.  It was a clean and a good size bedroom.  I did not mind having the shared bathroom and shower and actually had them available every time I needed to use.  The location of the apartment was great because I could take the train or tram to and from Amsterdam Central very easily.  If you are on a tight budget and don’t want to pay those God-awful prices to stay near Amsterdam Central and have a quiet place to stay and have a clean bedroom, then this is your place.  The bed was big and nice for me and I just needed a good night sleep for one night.  I liked my stay at Noah’s place."
-1,"When we got to the apartment it was not cleaned AT ALL. The beds were slept in and the entire unit was a mess. The guy who checked us in handed us sheets in a bag and told us to make our own beds, which included taking the dirty sheets from the previous guests off the bed, blood stains and all. Yes, blood. there was also blood on the floors throughout the apartment- absolutely DISGUSTING. Do not stay here, because the owner is not accommodating when it comes to issues like this, she said she would refund us $100, when we spent $900 on the listing. That is not fair compensation. If the unit had been cleaned then it would have been great, nice location close to everything, and a beautiful apartment. I just cannot leave a good review based on the horrible first night we had in the unit before the cleaning lady showed up the next day. Awful!!! "
1,They were SOOOO NICE!!! Absolutely loved the fat! Gorgeous windows everywhere that pour in the beautiful Amsterdam sunlight. Nick and Olga have a relationship and vibe that makes you feel RIGHT AT HOME! I seriously did mot want to leave. Thank you again NICK AND OLGA!!!!!!!!! 
-1,"I have been to Amsterdam several times and spent a month in amsterdsm this time and booked the small room Iranzu advertised for a week after the other place near museum district I stayed last year was taken.

Was overwhelmed by the state of the neighbourhood and the flat, its far from what was described in the advertisement besides its accesibility by tram. The neighbourhood looks like a migrant area with a few Turkish kebab places, middle east restaurants and mostly uninteresting shops except the restaurant at the corner of the building.

The flat itself is in an awful state. Its very messy with her stuff in boxes all over the living room AND under the bed and in the wardrobe of the tiny room I stayed (her clothings, bed linens, shoe, vacumm cleaner were chucked in the wardrobe) , the bed linens were not changed when I checked in and I had to spend some time to clear a space in the wardrobe and the bedside table to put my stuff. The bathroom is very dirty and the toilet seat is less than 10cm away from the toilet door, the bedroom cant be locked and the door handle fell apart after 2 days.

I wanted to move out after the second day but couldnt find a room because of the marathon event that weekend! 

Not a good experience "
-1,"Apologies at the outset for the downer of a review, but there is nothing cool nor renovated about this flat.  Nothing. How it is listed is sooooo not accurate I don't even know where to begin.  The only factual element about this listing is the location: it is a 15 minute walk to the Anne Frank Huis or 10 minutes to the museums, and there are a lot of restaurants in the area.  The apartment itself, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  

To wit - the kitchen was dark, dank, a bit grimy and with such antiquated appliances you would not want to cook there.  We were there two nights and never set foot in it.  Not once.  The bedrooms were small, cluttered, sort of clean (clothes piled everywhere - not ours! with bikes randomly taking up space) plus none of the bedrooms had curtains.  This despite the flat being at ground level.  The bathroom, ugh. Lighting was awful, the shower did not drain nor did it have a curtain so water splashed everywhere in the enclosed space.  Also, cold, concrete flooring throughout the ground level (and no carpets) did not help. 

Joris seemed like a nice guy and I think his heart is in the right place, but the reality of this place and his description could not be any farther apart.  With a little TLC and a lot of money, this apartment could be hip and cool and then it would be listed appropriately."
1,"Very comfortable and neat apartment, also very artistic and well decorated.  We loved the toys that were available for our 3 years old daughter. Esther and Thomas are very lovely people and very good hosts."
1,"We never met Thea but her mum Adriana and dad Mark were great.  The house was beautiful couldn't fault anything.  Adriana was amazing nothing was too much for her she had everything we needed or asked for, lovely lady.  The house was clean and homely, comfy bedroom too.  Would definitely recommend and would stay there again.  Thank you so much.  Lynda and Sean xx
"
1,Andrea was a very nice host and we loved her house! The neighborhood was pleasant and very convenient to get around with the trams buses and metro nearby. The room was clean and very cosy. Would go back again if we're back in Amsterdam!
-1,"I can not recommend this house!!! We rent Madelon's house for 4 days. We'd loved it on photos. It was a lovely house at first sight BUT  it was awfully dirty as you can see on the photos below! First night when we realized that non of sheet was ironed and dirty like used before, we'd like to cancel the booking. But she didn't accept that so we had to sleep with our coats. Sorry but I can't recommend this house!!! If Madelon improve her hospitality skills I can. Pls. check the links! Just copy&paste your bar.

1,"Since this is my first time on Airbnb I don't have anything to compare them to, but I thought Sam and Max were great hosts; they were friendly and interesting, but also respectful of my space. And they had good tips for things to do. The room was perfect, exactly as described and as it appears in the photos. The neighbourood is fantastic for wandering around little shops and cafés, but quiet and not clogged with people like the centre. I had free use of the bike too, so I could roam a bit farther afield whenever I liked. I would definitely stay there again -- in fact if I go back in the summer I'll check with them first."
0,"First, some things which might be improved:
* The Wifi was awful. Do not trust on it if you need it for work or something like that.
* Because the bathroom didn’t have a door knob, I got locked inside for almost 2 hours. I had to be rescued after yelling for a veeery long time. It wasn’t fun at all. Shit happens, but it could have been avoided if someone had reviewed that everything was ok.

And now, the good things :-)
* Marco organised a cab to pick me up at the airport, it was great, even if my flight arrived with some delay.
* I finally arrived almost at midnight but I got received very well.
* The room was big and the mattress was VERY comfortable.
* The ferry to cross to the Central Station was just 10-15 minutes by foot.
* The restaurant which was just below, was absolutely GREAT."
-1,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the apartment for 5 days, and on arrival waited over 30 minutes for the apartment to be cleaned, and for Margot to finish sending her emails. She showed us around, stood in the bathtub with dirty trainers and said ""Yeah, you're going to have to clean that.""

On our first nights stay Margot’s husband constantly rung the house phone and woke us up by banging on the door. We'd never met Margot's husband, but allowed him in with caution to retrieve his belongings. After a long day travelling this is not what you want! We felt unsafe and insecure knowing they would come into the apartment any time we weren't in. We even thought we'd walk in to find them in the apartment!

Furthermore, there was a lot of left over food and drink from previous guests in the fridge which fell out and cut my foot! The roof terrace is not private, it is a tiny gated section that is private to you, the roof is shared, and Margot's reason for not cleaning it was that it might rain.

Margot accused us of making holes in the floor, leaving fingerprints and using 16 towels, and wanted more money. She left us a negative review saying we had already left her one, which clearly we didn't. 

After all the places we've stayed in, we've never had a bad experience with anyone, and we respect the people who offer their apartments to us. Like anyone else, we expect privacy, security and hygiene in exchange for our money. I would not recommend the apartment to anyone.

On arrival we could overlook the inappropriate behaviour from Margot herself, but the problems kept coming and completely ruined our trip. We literally slept with one eye open, and being in a foreign country, feeling secure in your own space is crucial for us and its something Margot failed to provide. Margot failed in making us feel welcome and secure in her apartment."
1,The apartment was in a very good location. Central to everything. Literally with the Ann Frank house around the corner. 
1,"Fantastic location (don't be concerned by the proximity to the Red Light district.. the apartment is down a quiet, super cool little alley), within a short walking distance from much of the old quarter, an easy navigation to the museums, close to the central train station, etc. The apartment itself is cool, funky, well-designed and fun. The stairs are intimidating when you first encounter them, but you'll get used to them quickly. By the second day, we were scampering up and down (carefully)! All-in-all, a great place to stay in old Amsterdam."
1,"This is a very comfortable room in Amsterdam.  The room is very clean, and the host is very friendly.  The wifi in the room is very fast, and the breakfast is also delicious. We have a very good trip there! Thank you!"
1,"The green, quite place that Mirjam offers is everything she says and I loved my stay here.  The room is very large and bright, all the rooms very clean and the internet worked very well for my 4 days here.  I used the bus transportation from the stop immediately outside the apartment, and additionally I  had a great time biking from her house to the ferry and then around central Amsterdam.  Mirjam is a lovely, helpful, accommodating host.  While I was not at the apartment very much, I enjoyed every conversation we had and consider her my friend.  I look forward to someday returning to Amsterdam and staying with Mirjam again.  "
-1,We did not meet with the host at all. The host informed us that the apartment was non smoking but the whole building was reeking of cigarettes and weed. Also apartment seemed a lot smaller than indicated. And lots of noise at night from streets around. Pretty central location. Otherwise a bad experience. Probably the worst place I have stayed in through airbnb
-1,"Really a scam. The bathroom is located outside of the room, which is not evident from the photos, nor it is written in the description. I didn't expect that to go to bathroom at night I would have to put on shoes, and clothes, just in case if I meet someone on the stairs. "
1,"Our experience with Andrea was very good. Very friendly, easygoing and informative. We were more than delighted with the house and room. The bathrobes and other treats gave the touch to make you feel like you were in a 5 star hotel. The place is not very close from the city centre (25 mins on the metro), however is quite convenient and didnt happen to be a problem. Quiet neighbourhood. Good price, which it is very well appreciated. We would recommend it to anybody."
1,Really fantastic! Sunny was so friendly and very kind with me. The room is so confortable and surpassed my expectatives. I enjoyed a lot my time in Amsterdam and this place is really good to stay.  I hope to come back soon!
-1,"Dear Reader,

I'm sorry for the inconvenience but AirBnB's 500-word limit is simply not enough for us to give an accurate review of the apartment and our interactions with Christopher. Please view a full review on our PasteBin as this super-abridged version really deserves explanation.

pastebin d0t c0m/2d8pJ9Sf (paste into browser bar with corrected format of URL) -- Please please read! There is a story to be told about what we experienced!

TL;DR – Pros: Big bed, nice appliances and furniture, good location.
Cons: Our host was virtually unreachable and disrespectful to us in many ways, we had a bad experience getting into the apartment, some features listed in the AirBnB listing don’t actually work and a few things (some major) were broken or in bad shape, apartment wasn’t clean. I would not recommend this apartment (more specifically this host) to anyone until they decide to accommodate renters more politely.

-1,"To say this experience was a nightmare would be an understatement. For starters, look at the rules, scan your passport Please do not0 make the mistake I made and give these people your passport.  I, like most people, have never gave a bad review on anything. People usually only review pleasant experiences, but this was an exceptionally bad experiencethat needs to be shared with anyone looking for a place to stay in this magnificent city. For starters, the only common area you share with Sam and Max is the bathroom and messy kitchen. I was there for three morning, two of which I was woken up by jackhammers doing construction outside at 7am, and the last by husband Max barging into my room without warning. I beg you to not only take this review into consideration, but to read two other reviews(that would have changed my mind) from the past into consideration before choosing a place. I've stayed at AIRBNB places before, there's really fantastic people out there, these are NOT them. Make sure you learn and understand all the exras that come along with staying with these people, for they make up new rules on the fly based on their manic state of mind. I could go on and on about my bad experience but I've wasted enough time on these bad people. It's a little scary to think this unpredictable couple has all my information, for they forced me to give them my passport to scan.. This is not a necessary rule, you're paying through airbnb, they have your info, Manic Sam doesn't need it. Enjoy Amsterdam and stay away from this place! "
0,"The place its self is lovely  and in a great location.   Close to everything you could possibly need and only 5 stops away from the heart of Amsterdam on the 24 tram.   However the place is being managed by a company that on the surface seems very obliging but I found very frustrating to work with.   Starting from my arrival at Amsterdam station and being told on the day that if I did not arrive by 8:00pm they would charge me a fee - I am a business traveller and if I had known this information sooner I would have maybe been able to come on an earlier flight.   It caused me a lot of unnecessary stress.  The instructions on where to go and get the key were awful to ( for a non native ) and left me frustrated and upset till they had to send someone to send me the key while I waited at a restaurant.  I stay at Airbnb's 4 months out of the year in 7 european countries and have never had to email my host as much as I did with this group and each time I was left more irritated.  There is no iron, no laundry detergent ( they tried to tell me the fabric softener was the detergent) no instructions on how to use their convection oven or the temperature to the place.   List goes on and yet I loved the area because it is close to everything and very safe"
-1,"Hope you will fix the bed because it's broken ( or the mattress) and after 4 days of bad sleep my back is in pain.
It is almost impossible to take good shower if you are taller than 6 years boy.
The smell of the toilet was there all day long and in -1 degree we had to open windows to freeze out for some ventilation.
For 200$ a night which I could get 5 stars hotel I was expected for some class not a bad apartment in good location .
We was considered in the middle of our staying to move to hotel .
We let the host know that , she said that the smell is a problem on the center and that the bed is new.
If it wasn't so expensive or if the host were suggest a refund or not to charge us for the next days in case we move to hotel every thing was great 
And we had some chance to ""save"" our trip but even that was not an option

We fill that we paid top dollar for 
Bad experience .
It can fit to bechler party's or to young people with basic standards

-1,Deeply disappointed. 
1,It was a nice and clean apartment with a great location. It was very close to public transport which was a big plus.
0,"Pros: really cheap, good neigborhood, shop, bus stop and park nearby, you can park bicycle and chill on the nice terrace. Communication was good,  twe've got detailed instructions (how to get to the address from the airport and stuff).
Cons: shower was really dirty, with some kind of mold on the floor, toilet smells, toilet sit was wet most of the time. The room was fine, but it wasn't ready for the check-in, we've waited for about 4 hours (room was dirty and the cleaner was late, like a lot). There were 5 or 6 briefcases in the room, like it was stored or something. Also there were a huge dryer in the bathroom, that worked 24/7 I guess (bathroom shares wall with the room) and it was really hot even at night (although it was chilly outside during night time). Despite the fact that check-in was +4h delayed, check-out time remained the same (host reminded us about it).
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, but wasn't good either."
1,The boat house is perfect ! Very confortable ! Exactly as on the photos. It is situated in a very quiet area with a supermarket 2 minutes away. The bus stops just down the road and takes you to the central station in 15 minutes. Only regret : the weather was awfull and we could not enjoy the terraces !
1,"Fantastic property and host with great location....
breakfast was substantial and very good...
host was great with information and professional...

only issue; was mosquito's in room could be awful with AC  in room;
received bites every night... so be prepared! "
1,"A very sweet little self contained flat within easy walking distance from the metro, and on a very quiet street in a nice neighbourhood. The hosts were super communicative and friendly, and it was good to meet Bastiaan and have a nice conversation. They are right next door and made it clear that if I needed anything or had questions that they'd be happy to help. Nice touches in the flat with some fruit and a beer in the fridge. Highly recommended."
1,Just spent a night in the private room. Bastiaan and Saskia are great hosts - great hospitality. It's a modest room - perfect for one person or a couple. A 10 min walk gets you to the tram. Many cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood.
1,"Very pleased with the location - in  a quiet neighborhood but a stone's throw from lots of activity if you're looking for it. Wonderful tall windows in living room that look out onto the canal and let in tons of light. The steps inside leading up to the flat are not very deep so best to be careful climbing up/down to the second floor... however this will be true for *any* of these old, original buildings. If you leave windows open for circulation/fresh air there are no screens so expect mosquitoes to come in since you're right on the canal...they did with us! Don't expect this to be a flat that's designed just for lodger's use.... the owner also lives there so has his clothes, books, everyday stuff/ everyday clutter in this home you'll be using. "
1,"Best place, really nice and confortable if you want to live like a local. Lettie is a superhost giving guidance, support and details when you arrive she is wonderful"
1,"Great place , nice, clean and warm"
1,We have a lovely time - nothing was too much a very hospitable host! The neighbourhood was peaceful and people very friendly.
1,Location was great. Train is right outside the door as was a beautiful park. The beds are super comfy. The stairs are Amsterdam-awful! Hard to manage a suitcase and climb the steps (ladder-like). But that's most of Amsterdam. Communication was very fast and easy. I'd go back again. 
1,"Pablo and Dani are a very nice couple, they were polite and very sweet to us upon our arrival, we did not have any bad experiences with them personally.

The thing that was a bit odd was that they had rules posted to the back of the door as well as in shower room. Things to the effect of ""If you come come late be quiet, do not take long showers, only 5-10 minutes"" etc. Things that frankly are common sense and I don't need to be reminded of. Having the rules posted like that made me feel that I was imposing on them by being there and it was more of what you would expect if you were couch surfing or staying at a youth hostel. My travel mates and I felt uncomfortable and we were extremely self-conscious about our footprint on their apartment.

The bathrooms are also shared and they are not very clean. 

The neighborhood is very pretty (right by a park) and is entirely residential. We understood it was 20 minutes by tram to the city center but that is not accurate - this is a solid 30-35 minutes to the city center by tram, there is no way around it. Maybe they quoted 20 minutes based on the time it takes to get to the outermost edge of what is considered center...We originally got this place to save money as Amsterdam is so very expensive, but in the end we decided to spend extra $ to book another Airbnb for our last days so that we could relax and enjoy the city.

I am sorry to say because we really liked Pablo and Dani as people, they are very kind and very sweet, but I cannot recommend this Airbnb in good faith."
1,"Charlotte's flat was very comfortable, we had great time in Amsterdam. Very easy to find and near to the centrum !!! 
Thx"
-1,"A bad experience. The host send the wrong message about the room and arrange the same room for two groups of guest. And for the room later arranged, there is no quilt cover and pillowslip for the first night."
1,"The house is furnished with a taste and is enjoyable in many aspects; comfortable, answers all your needs and is also great for some serenity if one is searching for! Location is just perfect since it's walking distance to everywhere and also has a calm canal view. Although we didn't get the chance to meet the owner face to face, he was more than helpful thru the phone and we'll always remember this place as a beautiful house with a friendly and welcoming host. Thanks and hope to be back soon!"
-1,"We didn't met Jeff, but he was kind and open for communication. He gave us a discount because one of us cancelled the trip.
But the apartment was a mess. It is not possible that we pay the cleaning fee but there was dust everywhere, hair in the bathroom's sink, the carpet in the dining area was awfully dirty, we need to wash all the dishes before eating from them. Linens were clean but in disorder. Almost all the doors of fridge and lockets in the kitchen were broken.
The neighborhood is good, supermarket is near, tram/bus station at 5min walk."
1,Elsie was really kind and prepared the two rooms for us. Breakfast was really good and typical Dutch. She provided us very good tips for what to see and what not to see in Amsterdam.
-1,bad experience with airbnb the apt not like what is showing in the pictures 
1,"Imani provided us with a clean, beautiful apartment, close to Amsterdam's center. 25 minutes by a single bus to the city center is hard to beat.  It honestly felt like our own place! Thank you so much for making the experience wonderful!

"
1,"Gökay is an excellent host, he made us feel like home. Very nice and comfortable apartment in great place surrounded by nature in a residential area. Linked to the city center by tram 17. The best place to stay in Amsterdam. Highly recommended!"
1,Very nice house in a quiet neighborhood. The perfect place to relax a few days. We enjoyed and will come back.
0,Best thing was the location. It is very close to public transport and lets you get away with not needing to buy metro tickets. However don't expect much in terms of breakfast. Fridge was mainly stocked with half finished condiments and liverwurst. Good selection of drinks such as tea and coffee but kettle needs to be replaced as it seemed the bottom was flaking off. Not the most clean place I have been too and the shower seems to be missing a shower curtain. Overall it's not awful the beds were some of the best I used. But it would be best valued for the location only. 
-1,"The house is not so confortable: if you are staying at the entrance room, you have to enter in another room (where people are sleeping) or to exit the house door to reach the kitchen.....Bathroom is awful: 1 bathroom for 6 people is not enough and the shower seems a wall cupboard.
Location is good, near the centre and well-connected by public transport."
1,"Nadia is a very open and friendly person. My friend and me arrived late and night and it was no problem for Nadia. The room was clean and we even got tee, coffee and biscuits for the morning :) 
The room is perfect if you you are traveling with a friend, because it has to separate beds.
The only critic point was the not very nice neighborhood in which the apartment is situated. But besides that I can recommend the stay, even if you arrive at night, as it is close to the airport and to the central station (20min by metro).
"
1,"Good accomodation. You can easily reach the Central Station by bus or ferry.
Very good space for 4 people."
0,"The listing description and location were accurate, but we were not ever met by the host. Instead we were directed to a luggage drop off point to pick up the keys where our name was checked against a list of numerous AirBnB guests and properties. We came to learn that this listing is managed by some people that manage numerous AirBnB properties.

I usually enjoy AirBnB experiences because they are personal, not because I feel like just another guest, which is one of the reasons I keep using the service. In this case,  I did not get anything like that here. Additionally the host was unresponsive to inquiries over the weekend regarding the apartment's amenities. This was disappointing.

I never met my host, never got a walk through of the apartment, however did receive a 3 page handout about the neighborhood and the apartment. The place was what it said it was, but was a little dirtier than I have come to expect from AirBnB listings (dust on the higher surfaces, dingy smell in the shower and some visible soil).

All in all it was not a bad experience, but not at all what I was hoping for or what I've come to expect from an AirBnB experience."
1,"Nice enough studio flat, tho slightly away from the town centre.

Of course, this being the city of bikes, it's only a 20 minute cycle from the centre! Also very good value..."
1,everything went as declared. no bad experiences. 
1,Everything was very nice! I recommend!
1,"Everything was superb!
One of the bathrooms is absolut amazing! I Can recommend this accomodation really!
Thx"
1,"Everything mentioned in the listing was correct.
The host was in constant touch helping and suggesting things about Amsterdam "
-1,"A little bit disappointed after reading previous reviews. When we arrived I think it was the cleaner that talked a little bit but she didn't really know much, only told us about wifi. The woman on arrival also didn't know it was 3 of us staying so there was no bed for our 3rd guest. They then put on a dirty duvet that I saw on the floor in the cleaning pile for our double bed but did say they were coming back to sort out the beds after we told them about the 3rd guests. When we returned after the cleaning was finished there was no sheet on the sofa bed just a duvet. Then the double bed only had one single cover and 1 pillow for 2 people so it was cold at night. Overall, would not stay again but good location. "
-1,"Hi, so we had bad experience. 
1. We asked to paid 75 euros for cleaning (though we said we already paid). the man who open the house for us even showed us fake email from airbnb that we need to pay. only after i search my email i found the proof that this was paid already. so be carefull.
2. Only one toilet was working. the other one was broken and he told us that they will fix it shortly. they never did... so we were 8 people on the same toilet...
3. We came early so we had to pay 20 Euro in order to keep our luggages inside the house when the cleaners were cleaning the (URL HIDDEN) it can be free, its not bother anyone. the cleaners were there already. feels like greedy ppl.
4.We have being asked to paid for the early check out. who pay for early check out??????it was 8 am, not 4 am...so is it early?

1,"Lettie’s place is the perfect accommodation for a visit to Amsterdam. It is situated in a charming, easily navigated neighborhood and the attractions of the central part of Amsterdam are accessible by a short trip on the tram. The bedrooms are very comfortable and the bathroom is spacious and modern. The apartment was spotless. We arrived somewhat late in the evening after a long journey and Lettie greeted us with soup and bread knowing we would be hungry, which was so thoughtful!  We absolutely loved our stay and if we are ever in Amsterdam again, would love to stay here."
1,"We loved staying in your lovely house Marjolein, modern, spacious and stylish.  It is in such a convenient and central area yet lovely to be in a quiet road and to have the view of a shared courtyard  and the use of your little deck with outside furniture and a gas braai. The house was well stocked and very clean. The hostess was a pleasure to deal with and she was quick to respond to any communication. I would definitely recommend it! Philippa"
1,"The weather in Amsterdam was awful, but that was The best weekend ever! 
Thanks for Tom and his brother Floris! First we've met Tom, he showed us our really nice and quiet room and gave us some tips what to do in the evenening. Next day Tom's brother Floris arranged bikes for us and a list of nice spot's in Amsterdam. We've also spent a great night out together. So if anyone is looking for something more than just an accommodation, Tom and Floris is your choice! :)"
1,"Everything was perfect, I didn't have a chance to meet Thea in person, but her parents Adriana and Mark were very welcoming.
You could never dream of better hosts )"
1,"I feel Peter&Ann is like family. Me and my bf had a bad tragedy during first day and second day our trip we got delayed, miss the flight, lost our suit case and the worst my bf lost passport and stuck 8 hour in immigration. But They keep encouraged us and patiently wait. Most of important they give good service also. That bad day is my bf birthday she decorate the room and gives is short cake. It gives us great and good welcoming after all bad experience we had. Like a family great warm support. Something we will not find in hotel."
1,"Jelle welcomed us with a smile, good vibes and showed us the apartment. Once we've reached to the second floor of the apartment Jelle made the sheets and the pillow cases with a claim that the maid wasn’t at the apartment recently and we had to wait 20 minutes until he was done, the lacking of linens, covers for blankets and pillow cases in the first floor clearly showed that the apartment wasn't prepared for guests. Before and after we checked in Jelle had a long time responding to our messages and when he does respond it's usually a flat out message with not so much helpful information. One time we tried to call him via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and he declined the call because he was in a restaurant, now I know he has a personal life as well as any other guy but we didn’t get from him any desire to go the extra miles for his guests. And also like other comments here before mine we suffered also from a cold apartment and the wind was constantly entering thru the windows/walls. The heating was a little bit off in the sense that it was always turning off by itself or in the better scenario it was switching to a low volume heating. The shower has a ridiculously low water pressure once you turned up the hot water, and the bathroom toilets makes an awful sound every time you flush. Other than that everything was great."
1,"I had a lovely 5-day stay in Jakobus apartment. The apartment is exactly as pictured; clean, bright, well equipped and located in a lovely old building overlooking a canal. Very comfortable bed. The location is great for exploring the city, and close to the central station. Jakobus was a friendly, attentive host, and very easy to communicate with. I can highly recommend this place, and would be happy to stay here again."
1,"Julie has such good energy!
I booked the place completely last minute and she was super nice about it and helped me with everything I've needed.
Would stay again!"
1,We loved our stay! It was a great location. It’s about 10 minutes outside of Centraal but there’s a market right outside the apartment and it’s nice to be in an area that’s not touristy. It’s super easy to get into the city. Ewa was wonderful and the apartment is clean and stylish. Please note that it’s not for anyone who cannot easily climb three steep flights of stairs multiple times a day. 
-1,"hurm. 
room is clean and okay but :
1) there's no privacy at all. the room's door has no lock.
2) u're separated by the other guest room only by a curtain.
3) there's a other guy staying there - in a store-like room with a lot of thing in there. a store
4) i wasnt given a key of the place during my stay. ????? coming late at night was so lucky the other guest is still awake to open the door for me.
5) im full aware of the shower is at another house/place. yes, but im denied the access to the place. his cousins were all giving excuses to bring me there. there's no extra keys bla bla bla, and they have something to do in the morning (i prefer to shower in the morning). ended waking me up at 1am asking me to go shower. how could u??? i decide when i want to shower. thanks. period."
-1,"I really not recommend this place.  The only good thing is the situation but it was also uncomfortable because most of the activities started near the Station so it was like 30 minutes by feet. There is a bad in front of the bedroom window and you literally cannot sleep any day of the week. During the weekend they end playing around 6.30 am. There was no kitchen pans or anything. We didn’t even have knives. They told us “there is a kitchen in the top floor you can use, it is usually open” but it was always closed so we couldn’t use it and not even cook a thing because there was nothing in the room. You share the bathroom with other people and they don’t clean it regularly. I really think this is the worst option I could have ever chosen. It really worth’s it to take something nearer the Station because this was so expensive for such a bad experience."
1,Great little apartment just a short walk from a metro station which is 15 mins from the centre. Very clean and modern- would definitely recommend!
1,"Very nice host. Losif was very helpful and made us feel welcomed. 
The house was clean and near to the metro station."
1,"Jan and Desti were simply amazing and awesome people. Serendipity was exactly as described if not more. One of the best Airbnb places that my partner and I have stayed in. Jan and Desti went above and beyond, we were pleasantly surprised at the variety of breakfast options; cereal, jam, butter, ham, juice, milk and cheese. They made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible by providing bikes and loan metro cards. I can not recommend their place highly enough. P.s. loved the stroopwafel, as good as Belgium waffles if not better!"
1,"Great location, friendly host!"
1,Great place in a great location if you want to live in a quiet area just a few blocks from lots of restaurants and bars. Close to everything if you want to explore the city and bike rental just a few min away. Wonderful rooftop terrace where you can relax after a day exploring the city. Great host that was very helpful and would definitely recommend this place! 
0,"Overall it wasn't a bad experience and the house was really nicely decorated but the sound of the bells ringing at the church next block was so loud that I could only sleep lightly. (Such a torture. It rings quite frequently... every half an hour or so) The rooms were not very much soundproof in general. Avoid if you  are expecting a really private space (not to mention that the toilet is not inside the room) but recommend if you are looking for a cosy, clean, spacious house with impressive interior design."
-1,"Una mala experiencia! La anfitriona no hace placentera tu estancia, al llegar solo te indica lo que no puedes hacer, es muy insitente, la habitacion es angosta e incomoda, ella siempre esta en la sala como espiandote de no robarte algo! Ella se queda en la sala viendo tv y no deja dormir con gusto en la habitacion! No te ayuda con referencias de la ciudad, no recomendable por la actitud aunque la ubicacion es buena.

A bad experience! The host does not make pleasant your stay, arriving just tells you what you can not do, it is very insitente, the room is narrow and uncomfortable, she is always in the room as spying not steal anything! She stays in the room watching tv and not let them sleep warmly in the room! It does not help you with references of the city, not recommended by the attitude Although the location is good"
-1,It was a bad experience. We struggled to get home and when we arrived we found that we could not stay because it was the birthday of the son and had no place for us. We got a friend's house which had no reference as it did not belong to Airbnb but as we were far from the center and only two days in the city accept . The experience was good the other house were very friendly and the house was fine.
-1,"It was a very bad experiences for us , the guy was very agressive and irrespectful. 
The door didn't have lock, the guy told us that he can do nothing to help us.
After 5 minutes talking with him, he put us at the door, he just said ""it's your problem, not mine"".
We prefered to look after another hotel because we do not felt safety.
I would never recomend this place
"
1,The apartment is very nice!
-1,"Our stay at this Airbnb was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. I do NOT recommend staying here at all. 

The pictures make the place look amazing and very inviting and posh-like. In reality- the place is very very small and outdated and hard to function. 

It is on the bottom floor of an office and has apartments above it so it is constantly loud 24/7. They would start stomping around at 7-8 in the morning and wouldn't stop until 3-4 at night. So we were able to get no sleep at all and had a constant headache bc of it. Also- people would constantly smoke outside the door so the place always smelled like smoke. And the door would constantly be slamming. 

The shower would leak into the other part of the bathroom which had no drain so the shower water would just sit there. Made it quite annoying when you had to brush your teeth or wash your face. 

I found bugs in my bed. Yes- literal bugs. I took pictures and wish I had a way to post them. I also had blood on my comforter. And my friend stayed downstairs and had blood on his as well. The blankets and sheets smelled like they hadn't been washed in weeks. 
The place was all over very dirty which is weird considering we pay a cleaning fee. 

Lex however was very nice and always responded to messages. He was very helpful. Although since reaching out to him regarding the issues and being unsatisfied with this apartment- he has gone silent. I am now having to go through Airbnb so I can get a partial refund bc this place was not clean, nice or suitable for staying. I couldn't be more disappointed with this place. It was so bad we considered finding another Airbnb or hotel while we were there but we decided to suck it up and stay since we paid $233 a night. 

Do yourself a favor and DO NOT STAY HERE. I am confused as to why there are so many good reviews about this place...? It definitely tricked me! 

Worst place ever. "
0,"Location is pretty good if you drive. Free parking with a tram stop just downstairs. Brings you to Amsterdam city in about 20 minutes, stress-free.
Just around the corner of the apartment are some bakeries, a supermarket and a nice seafood eatery which has some of the freshest items around. We ate there everyday. 
The apartment itself is big although a little dusty. There's a washing machine, stove and refrigerator. 
Not a bad experience although it would be great if the host communicated more."
1,We stayed at Emils place for three nights and we were even allowed to bring our dog. Emil is a very caring and friendly host. Everything was very clean and even breakfast was provided. The room is located outside of the city of Amsterdam but the metro station is really close and there are some very nice parks around. It was a great stay!
1,"Our staying at Carolina's house was just perfect! Everything in the apartment is so nice, clean and comfortable! The whole neighborhood is very nice, with wonderful Holland architecture, a lot of trees and grass, and shops and bus stop are very close. 

Carolina was a great host!  Very friendly, open and communicative, she helped us with with some tips and advice, and really made us feel like at home. 

We strongly recommend you to stay at Carolina's place and enjoy your Amsterdam adventure in an amazing way! "
-1,"Elsie is a kind hearted lady and she treated us with open arms. She is both talkative and hospitable, while offering us much help in finding the tram station and getting familiar with Dutch culture. Football, politics and sightseeing spots are all topics we discussed during breakfasts, which were quite interesting and unique. Though there was one day that the heater broke down, she managed to find two repairmen on a Saturday morning and fixed the problem. It is always hard to get anybody to work on weekends so she is really a woman with her own magic power. Moreover, there are two beautiful doggies in the house bringing happiness. Despite all these good parts, some awful moments still occurred. 
One night she broke into the locked bathroom when a friend of mine was taking a shower just to tell him that he had took too long to take a shower. And the other time, she forbid the girls to use the hair-dryer because she thought it was too loud. In the end, we had to sleep with wet hair. 
For those travelers who want more privacy, maybe a host at home is not the best choice. For us, when we choose which place to stay next time, we'll take into consideration not to have the company of a host."
-1,"I'll start with the good:

Great location, the hosts were accommodating and there weren't any pressures with check-in/check-out times (although admittedly, we arrived at noon and left earning morning, so there was nothing to complicated things)

The apartment was nice, almost like in the pictures but a bit scruffier. There's been a great use of lighting in the photos and maybe a bit of photoshop to make it look like a nice hotel. There's nothing wrong with it, but there are marks and scruffs on the walls, some of the detailing isn't quite as nice as it appears. The shower a bit weak and lukewarm.

Now the bad: we didn't get the apartment that I saw in the pictures. The host claims it was a technical glitch on AirBnB's side but haven't received any evidence of that. I know they have multiple apartments so it appears they've combined photos of two to make one.

There was one room, not two like listed. In the bedroom was one of the beds pictured and also a bunk bed. A BUNK BED. I wouldn't have rented an apartment with a f*cking bunk bed, I'm not 8-years-old. Four people in one bedroom? Ridiculous. We feel like we were scammed. Everything felt like a complete bait & switch here, and even if AirBnB failed to change the pictures like the host says they did, that still doesn't explain the BUNK BED. There was never ever any mention or photo or hint of a bunk bed. 

Maybe the host didn't scam us, but he took a photo of the room that explicity cuts out the bunk bed, showing active and flagrant dishonesty.

We never met our host, but people who work for him. He obviously has multiple apartments that he rents out on AirBnB like this. I've had encounters from people like this before, and although they've all been more pleasant experiences than this one, they were less pleasant than renting from people who actually live in their apartments. These are the only types of apartments I will be renting in the future - when people actually live there, they're invested in the place and are in turn invested in your experience. Hosts like this one are only interested in taking your money."
-1,"The flat is very well located, at the center, 5 min from the Dam.
However, there was a problem with the only toilet in the flat that didn't work and got fixed at noon the following day.
The spare bedroom is also problematic to sleep in, since the old pipe system goes through the walls, so whenever someone opens the hot water there is an awful noise.
With saying that, Fred was very kind, professional and willing to help, doing whatever  he could.
At the end, we stayed only one night out of 4 and found an alternative place (paid extra money) and got a partial refund.

1,"We enjoyed our stay! Friendly people, quite environment, relaxed!
Thanks"
1,Roberts a nice guy and the place is well located just west off the nine streets.
1,"Marjolein's house is in a fantastic location right next to Vondelpark and Museumplein. The house is large, very comfortable and clean and is perfect for those traveling as a group. All of the standard amenities were provided and check-in was easy. Marjolein was quick to respond to questions and provided useful information about the house. 
We really enjoyed being able to sit out in the garden and on the balcony while the sun was out and playing with Juultje the cat. 
This house is great for those looking for something central and with a lot of cool character. "
0,"The houseboat is very cozy and well-furnished. From inside, you have a beautiful view onto the Gracht through the big windows. They are old and thus you hear quite much what’s going on outside. The street in front of the houseboat and the Noordermarkt is busy, especially at night on weekends, because there are some bars (take earplugs with you, if you are a light sleeper – and also a sleeping mask). However, this place in Amsterdam is nice and you can easily reach everything by foot. The bed is very comfy and the bathroom right next to it is renovated. The couch is very big (a cozy lamp next to it would be wonderful) and the TV is a modern flat screen. There was also a mobile air condition standing in the living room but we didn’t use it. 
 
Upon arrival, we met a representative in front of the houseboat in order to get the keys. Surprisingly, he said that the houseboat is “shut down” since there was a plumbing problem with water on the floor etc. We were very disappointed as we really were looking forward to living in this houseboat and paid more for it than we usually do for an apartment. They said, we haven't been informed about it since it just happened the day before. We were shown a “better” apartment 500m closer to the very center but that was not what we were looking for (no special view, no TV in the livingroom…). We were told that our options are to stay in this apartment or leave and have a refund. When we decided to have a refund, the other representative offered us to take a look into the houseboat together with us. So we carried our luggage back to where we started. When we entered the houseboat, there was absolutely nothing to complain about! We were told that we can stay in the houseboat if we do not flush any toilet paper. Fine for us, if we could only stay there!
In the end we had a wonderful time there!
"
0,"Place was nice, easy to get to public transportation, and had a moderate amount of places nearby. Sven was very accommodating and helpful. Wednesday and Thursday night you could hear a pin drop it was so quiet. Friday night, however, whoever was downstairs hung out with three of their annoying friends who played loud music and sang awful pop songs as loud as they could until 3:30 AM, and it was just terrible. That part could easily have been a fluke. Sounded like maybe they had friends in from out of town and it was a special occasion. Either way, whoever lives downstairs was a major annoyance on the last day we were there. Outside of that, everything was awesome with this place."
1,"A lovely place - small room indeed, but everything needed for a perfect stay is included - a private bathroom, a comfy bed, a micro kitchen with a microwave and a fridge, and most of all privacy. Annette is a perfect host. The cats are awfully quiet at night, which usually is not their typical behaviour :) The hallway was full of treats - fruits and candy. Will definitely come back! "
1,awesome host and such a lovely room! :) Sunny did whatever he could to make my stay as best as it can be. big thank you to him
-1,"Awful and unfriendly experience! At the beginning she charged my friends and me 25 € for early check-in (if 11 am is early). After that, she came to the place during our booking to fill the apartment with 2 couches. Finally, a friend of her break into the apartment at 10 am with a second key asking us for leaving the apartment within 1 minute! She even wanted to charge us 50 € on top because she thought we were 5 people instead of 4 (the fifth was a girl a friend met)! What a nightmare of person! The location is not bad, nice neighborhood."
1,"The photos of Miro’s apartment on the app do not do his place justice, his place is stylish and super super clean!
We could not get anymore Central if we tried - local bars, cafes, coffee shops and restaurants on your door step! The Red Light District on one corner and The Old Town on the other corner. Shower is extremely powerful and beds are super comfortable - we were out most of the weekend so didn’t spend and awful lot of time in the apartment so the noise never bothered us.
Would 100% recommend staying here!!"
1,"It’s such a lovely place and very close to dining places, it’s a minute walk to a tram station. The place is very clean and comfy and many appliances are available for us to use. The balconies and the rooftop is such a lovely place to chill in and just admire the view. Loved the stay here!"
1,Great room with a lovely host and in a fantastic location. Made to feel extremely welcome on arrival with great guest information in the room.
0,"Very nice location. Cute appartement, exactly as the pictures. We stayed one week with 2 kids and we were disappointed by the kitchenette : very very small and the cooktop was out of service. 
Also, we didn't have access to the cleaning material the whole week... Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay and the apartment."
-1,"I received messages from Rob on my mobile but apparently Rob couldn't see my replies. I then contacted him on the phone number that was on my reservation  and leave messages what he also not see. Afterwards he admit that he didn't listen to the messages.
When I rely that he didn't receive my messages I phone him from my mobile. I talk to him but  he said that he couldn't hear me properly because of a bad connection. I was not connected to my e-mail and rely on the number that he provided. We then arrived at his place at 15:00 and received a messages on his nameplate that he will be back at 17:00. He send me a sms and said that he will send his mobile number what I did not receive. We wait there at his door as we had nowhere else to go and have our luggage with us. It was very windy, cold and also raining a bit. I phone him every now and then without response. At a quarter to six I get nervous and phone my sun in South Africa (he was not available earlier) and ask him to send a message through airbnb to Rob, what he did without response. Luckily at 18:30 a nabour of Rob who saw us sitting on our suitcases invited us to her house for a cup of coffee and to make use of her bathroom. At 20:00 I phone my sun again and ask him to contacted Rob on his mobile what he find on my e-mail. At 20:00 Rob appear saying that he thought that we was not coming.
It was a very bad experience far from home, waited for 5 hours in bad weather. I did make a booking, I did pay and didn't cancel and was definitely not expected such bad manners. And then I even had to make my own bed. The following morning he admit that there was messages on his phone and apologise and also let us leave our baggage there  till the afternoon. But still that is definitely not how to treat your guests. I also have a guesthouse in South Africa and know what is hospitality and good manners and when your guests did not show up you still got the money and did not lost a thing. "
-1,"The host did not make me feel welcome. Communication was extremely poor. Do not expect prompt answers with any concerns or questions, but expect generic responses from the ""host"" of this AirBnB. It was nearly impossible to get in contact with anyone in regards to checking in. They were late and weren't even the real host of the apartment. I was told to arrive at the unit at a specific time, and waited 40 minutes for someone to arrive - not the ""host"" rather a woman with a set of keys who did not even know how to access the unit. Sammy was a poor host. It isn't even his but rather one of 200 in Amsterdam that this group manages apparently. They do not know what they are doing and have zero communication and organizational skills in regards to communicating with their guests. I sent numerous texts, emails and calls to the host with any questions or concerns only to be ignored. I received generic text messages and emails from Sammy about my stay there, in which when I replied, would receive no reply back. I had to check in a day later than I had booked due to flight changes and never received any prompt responses from the host to find a solution to checking in at a different time. Upon arrival, the house itself is spacious, beautiful and unique, but was marred by the terrible experience with those managing this place. There was no hot water so me and my guest could not take a hot shower. After calling the ""host"" which was not even Sammy, rather a colleague, about the hot water issue, they said they would solve it within an hour and never called me back or solved the problem even after I had texted, emailed and called the ""host."" I had to fill pots with water and heat it up on the stove to fill the bathtub halfway to clean myself for the time I stayed there. Do not stay here and do not book with these people unless you want to waste your money. This was an awful AirBnB experience and whoever really lives here should find someone else to manage their home for rental.  As for those who manage it, you have no right to ignore your guests and have an obligation to creating a positive experience."
-1,"The only positive thing about the studio is that its close to everything. In our entire stay (6 days) we didn't meet Fabiano, his friend greeted us & took us to the apartment, to surprisingly find out that we need to climb a very steep narrow ladder (diffidently  cant be defined as stairs) , getting our luggage to the apartment was sort of ""mission impossible"", however after heavy team work, we were able to enter to the studio to find out that its filthy furnished, ""the only clean thing was the bed sheet"" & dust and dirt covering the floor, at this time we have decided to cancel our reservation, however all hotels nearby were fully booked, so sadly we decided to stay &Live the drama!!! to explore that no toilet paper were available, most of the lamps bulbs are burned (dim lightning), only 2 old dirty towels are available, the room smells disgusting  awful weed, the shower drainer is slow,loud music from the store below prevented us from sleep, for our entire 6 days no cleaning was done although we paid the cleaning fees, we contacted fabiano several times, but he completely ignored us!!!!  Diffidently Doesn't deserve $1,035 for 5 nights :("
-1,"The most dirty accomodation I have ever had. I was completely shocked when I've came to the flat. The bathroom was dirty and awful. The sofa was very short, just with an ugly sleeping bag. I've rather found something else. I couldn't imagine I would be there over the night."
1,"Lovely space, great location, accommodating host. Definitely recommend! "
-1,"Location is good and the apartment is nice. But we didnt have a good  experience at all because there was a mouse in the kitchen the last night, and I dont think I need to explain here how we felt about it!!!! 
We didnt have a door at the bedroom so we “barricade“ ourselves using the tables... and of course we cant keep thinking about the mouse running around our cheese every night. Awful experience!
"
-1,"I do not recommend this place at all for anyone who cares enough about basic comfort and cleanliness. Nothing in here felt right. The space was terribly noisy (doors banging, keys jiggling, thin walls x10). Host rules are not respected by host himself as the walls are damaged and tainted, there's a lack of privacy and bathroom and shower separated from the space in a not classic configuration for an appartment. The hall is pretty much just an empty white box with 10 doors with nothing else. The LEAST welcoming place I visited. I slept at hostels that were better on all plans. Porta potty sitting outside tainting the air coming in the only widow of a room too small for that queen sized bed, that left little space reaching that window. Host was cold, left as soon as I arrived and basically never replied to my messages. I had to leave and cancel because these are not restful conditions and seems unreliable at best, or sorta scam-ish. Host wanted to keep all my money after I contacted airbnb support, even if I was entitled to at least 50%. He didn't respect his own cancellation policy. Thank goodness airbnb support was wonderful !"
-1,"is a scammer deceives people offering something and at the last moment you change the place you booked for or something totally unknown in a different site, if that was not enough, it threatens you and does not reimburse the money. NEVER BOOK WITH THIS SCAMMER!!! "
1,"I travelled in November with a friend. Andrea was very friendly and she made a lot of effort in preparing useful information about Amsterdam. The room is stylishly furnished and the beds are very comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the complimentary wine and pralines provided by Andrea. There is also a microwave and plates, glasses & cutlery are provided. Very nice touches! The apartment is located in a multicultural neighbourhood but the day & night buses and metro are very close. I warmly recommend the apartment! And I think this is the best value for money you can get in Amsterdam."
1,"Miranda and Paul were fantastic hosts that made our stay in Amsterdam that much more special, we enjoyed having the best of both worlds by staying in the countryside next to a cute little church while still only being a short trip away from the city.
We were treated each morning to some amazing home made jams,fresh coffee and orange juice and a selection of breads and cheeses, great start to a day!
Sasha was also able to borrow their spare bike for our stay which was a great convenience, totally recommend staying here especially if u want to see more of Amsterdam's country side"
-1,"Bad experience. When we got to the floor we saw that there were people inside, the previous tenants. The host was supposed to wait for us at 12.15, instead I had to call him to the phone, which was off, so 40 minutes without response until I decided to call Airbnb. After over an hour he called me and said that those who were supposed to leave the apartment at 12 (Yes, we supposed we entered at 12.15) is not gone. When he called me he asked 20 minutes to clean the apartment. I do not know how to clean a floor in 20 minutes, the host either. There were ashes of cigarettes on the couch, the kitchen deserves a separate chapter, suffice to say I had to clean it, Pringles cans to hold the windows ... The building entrance was dirty with magazines on the floor. Apartment smelly, dirty and does not correspond with the announcement. Without washing machine, the microwave is decorative, the ad says 1.5 bathrooms, but only has a bath. The truth is the only thing exceptional location. I do not recommend at all."
1,"We enjoyed our stay in this little apartment. It is perfect for a couple and in a great area (a few blocks from the Heiniken museum ) easy to get around. Apartment was clean, and bed was comfy. The only complaints we had were that the hallway to the apartment smelled awful (but didn't smell into the apartment) and the shower is pretty much right in the kitchen. "
1,Very nice apartment to stay
1,Nick and Olga were really nice and gave us information about how to get around. The flat is pretty spacious and the room was cozy. Both me and my friends enjoyed our staying.
1,"Wouter's appartment has everything you need and has all facilities to keep you comfortable. Heating is highly efficient. The appartment is a 10 minute tram ride into the city. The tram stops out the front of the appartment which is very convenient. The apartment is well furnished with controls for heating on the wall. We really loved Amsterdam and would definitely stay here again. 

P.S. If you are arriving from schipol airport and you are considering a cab ride, use official taxi rank as we got scammed by an unofficial taxi driver overcharging us. 

"
1,Despite only having a short stay at George's my Girlfriend and I felt really at home. As we are awful with directions we did get lost but as soon as we arrived George gave us a complete run through of the city. Tram stop is 2 minutes away from the apartment - you couldn't ask for much more
1,"Hilde is a great host! She is very responsive and accommodating to any needs you may have. Her apartment is also in an excellent location, as you can walk to almost anywhere you would want to go in the city.  "
1,"We enjoyed our stay, and would recommend this place to anyone up for an adventure."
-1,"Boat was smaller and less stable than expected - it rocked a lot. I could not stand up. Bed sheet was too small for bed! Chemical toilet was missing. No bikes as promised. The boat locaction was moved from central Amsterdam to distant and inconvenient North Amsterdam after booking. We were offered a day cruising the boat ourselves as compensation. The steering soon failed in the major shipping lanes of the Ij - terrifying. Had to be rescued by police who only towed us to the side. They said the ropes were unsafe. We were not allowed to sleep in the temporary location, so we had to go to a hotel for 2nd night. No offer of refund for 2nd night as yet despite asking! Bad experience."
0,"Great location and hospitality. However, the place is awfully a lot smaller than in the pictures."
-1,"Very very disappointed. First bad experience with airbnb. We have booked a whole apartment for ourselves, arrived there after a 6 hour drive, they tell us IN FRONT of the apartment that it is infested with bedbugs (no informations whatsoever before we arrived, and the response was very slow, not reactive - because this host has a lot of apartments in Amsterdam he has some kind of secretaries that does not reply fast enough, and the address was not exact on the site resulted in waiting and wasting a lot of time.) They offered me instead a single bedroom, that was a bit further than the other from the center, it was already unbearable for us that they offer us this because we booked an amazing apartment, so we were very disappointed. The thing that was unacceptable is that they did NOTHING to apologize to us, they even got us to pay the single bedroom more expensive then the real price. I’m sorry but I really can’t suggest this host to you, I really had a bad experience, and a single sorry and a discount would cost you nothing Giampaolo. I was really disgusted by his behavior, didn’t even talk to me, but needed his assistant."
-1,BERY DISAPPOINTING! WE LEFT AFTER ONE DAY DUE TO THE VERY BAD SMELL COMING UP FROM THE RESTAURANT BELLOW AND SIX(!) CELLULAR ANTENNAS SITUATED ON THE BALCONY AND ROOF. OVERALL OT WAS A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE.
-1,"Pretty disappointing first Air BnB experience for me. This place has a great location, but is not very good value for the money.

We had 4 people stay for 2 nights and it was kind of cramped, basically one big room with beds everywhere. I have never seen a shower like theirs, where you just shower in the bathroom next to the toilet. The drain is just on the floor. The room doesn't flood because the water pressure is slightly better than a dribble.

The best way I can describe the experience is that I came away feeling like they were trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of the transaction, rather than looking to share their city and make a little money on the way which is more of what I'm looking for.  The price for the room was very high (I wouldn't recommend 6 people staying there unless you just want a bed and not much room), and I felt like I was getting scammed out of the security deposit which we had to pay in cash. They charged 10 euro per day for internet but the internet didn't work. I had to argue to get that money back. Also the cleaning fee came out of the security deposit which was not explained to us ahead of time. I found this out when they only returned 150 euro out of 200 for the deposit because we had to pay for cleaning and internet.

We had trouble meeting up to exchange keys which was partly my fault for not having a phone. I came late and had to try to connect by wifi. I ended up waiting for about 45 minutes while he talked on the phone on the street. After he got off the phone he acted like I was a huge inconvenience for making him wait. Maybe true but I also paid 50 euro for late check-in. I think with such a high price for late check-in I can do without the guilt trip.

Clean and relatively safe (though there's a lot of street noise). It's not terrible, but I would not stay again for the price. If you are looking for bare-bones accommodation in a good location ask yourself if you can do better for the price. 

I will probably stick to hostels in the future."
1,"Chris’s place was very neat and easily accessible from the main station. The bathroom was outstanding and much greater than expected. We found our bed to be cozy and the room to be quite hot, but the fan helped a ton. The stairs were very steep so don’t come home stumbling too much!"
1,"I can't speak highly enough of my experience at Jillis and Cristina's Apartment.  I was possibly the most awful guest after a cancelled flight, missing luggage and customs issues.  Despite showing up several hours late (with little to no warning) I found Cristina writing me a note about how to get into the apartment and a nice place to grab a bite to eat.  

As expected the room was immaculate and in a great location- I wish I had the chance to enjoy it more.  Great accommodation and even better hosts.  I owe these two my sanity during a wild four days of flying trying to get to Sri Lanka.

I would suggest to anyone- Thanks to the great hosts!"
1,"We did not get to meet Bastiaan, but a friend greeted us on arrive and was very nice and helpful. Even when we had a small issue at midnight on our last night, Bastiaan and his friend answered our call right away and were extremely helpful.

The studio is as described and shown in the pictures. It is nothing fancy, but we were not planning on spending much time there anyway. One note is that it is very easy to hear neighbors if you are looking for a place without noise. Also, the stairs going up to the apartment are very steep. There are only about 10, but I would not recommend for anyone who has trouble climbing stairs.

The location is great. There is a bar just a couple doors down, as well as some restaurants. Everything major you would want to see in Amsterdam is within a 15 minute walk."
0,"Hannah is lovely that must be said first up, and generous. He kind gesture of a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon was well received.
However much could be said about first impressions and in this case they weren't good. The entrance to the building from the ground floor to the second floor apartment is awful. A dirty, dark, hall with filthy carpets not cleaned for months, reminiscent of a student dorm, old mail scattered all over the floor, baby carriages, bikes and other obstacles that one must climb over to reach the apartment. With heavy or large bags that's a huge feat.
The apartment is nice. It needs a good clean though and the bathroom leaves a lot to be desired as the shower leaves water all over the floor, there's no receptacle for soap or shampoo so that all such things fall on or are left on the floor. The cat litter bin under the bathroom sink means you have cat grit under foot, it smells after a day and though I love cats I didn't plan that I'd be cleaning a cat box on my honeymoon.
The cat is grumpy and only wants food so there's no benefit of good cat company here.
Because of the cat the apartment has a musty cat smell which in summer is easy to get rid of by opening windows, but in winter ?
The apartment is definitely lived in by Hannah when not rented out and someone (like me) may not enjoy finding personal possessions so evidently left on view.
This is a fun apartment but not for adults expecting luxury or what one can find on Airbnb elsewhere.
Given that I hope Hannah has success and perhaps takes on board these comments and makes a few improvements."
1,Great location.  
1,"Marcella's place it's a very good place to stay in Amsterdam. It's easy to get from Centraal Station and from the best's places in Amsterdam. Ok she have a list of rules, but it's his house, every house have rules. And don't think it's a bad thing: none of his rules will give you a bad experience in this room, only if you are a crazy person who think ""oh it's Amsterdam, I can do everything that I want!"". No, his room it's not a hotel room, it's a cozy house with two lovely girls.
I really liked the days that i spend in this room. I have no complains about it."
1,"What a wonderfuls days we live in Amsterdam. Thanks to Patricia who makes everything to do our holidays fantastic.
Her home and bikes did we thought we were less tourist (really is what we are);-). Very recommended."
0,"The description of the place is fair and lists all advantages and disadvantages of the place, except one major one that we had to experience: mice (mouses).
It all started with a small misunderstanding of the arrival time but was quite quickly sorted out. Then came an unpleasant smell on the steep steps going up to the floor. The bedsheets were not the cleanest when we arrived, although for the second night we got some clean one. The biggest problem we had was that we had unwelcome company during the two night we staid having mice in the place. We could not sleep too much because of this and were quite tired the next days. We spoke many times with the hosts who promised to fix the problem at least for the second night we stayed but without any luck on catching the mice (or more of them appeared).
Otherwise the place is as it is described, small and not fancy/luxurious at all but which could be very good for most. Very close the the centre and everything you would like to visit, if not too lazy without any kind of public transportation.

Without this bad experience with the mice I would recommend the place to anyone who does not care about luxury rather only wants a place to sleep and shower close to the city centre. "
-1,"The apartment was clean at first glance but open a cabinet and you could see trash like the cleaners were in a hurry and just stuffed everything in to the drawers.
We had an awful experience with check-in. First, the EZ Drop was not conveniently located. We were given the incorrect keys and took us an additional 3 hours to get this issue corrected. It was cold and rainy so this on top made things worse. The host Martijn further insulted us with a reminder to please check out on time or else fees would apply instead of being apologetic about the initial check-in experience. We requested a refund but it was declined and so we asked again to please just send us what he thought would be a fair compensation for the poor experience but he never replied. 
The apt is conveniently located in the heart of the red light district and is very noisy so please expect this. The window coverings are see-through so don't expect to sleep in if you have light issues. The apt is extremely small so if you are a big person this isn't the place for you. All in all, I feel like the host could have rectified the disappointment but it seems the bottom line is more important than customer service. 
Our conclusion is that this apt is very overpriced and would look elsewhere if I could do it all over again."
1,"You will really feel like home at Nadia's place. She is very nice, helpful and communicative. You can find everything you need in the room :-) If you have a metro ticket it's about 15 minutes from centre of Amsterdam. We were first guests at Nadia's place and I can only recommend her, she is a great host."
0,"The room is neat.
But the host made me wait for over an hour. I had a bad experience."
-1,"Hi, The listing was accurate and the neighbourhood was beautiful. That was not the issue, We didn't actually meet our host as far as I am aware we met one of his friends who didn't have the keys and had to go get some keys cut which he left in the plant pot as we went out.  When we actually arrived at the place it was an absolute mess, it smelt terrible and we got asked to come back after the cleaners had been. we returned three hours later and the place was still a mess, not the best start to our holiday at all! 
We had to sit there and wait for the cleaners to clean. After a being up since 4am we couldn't wait to get clean and have a shower, but this proved difficult as the boiler had broke!!! possibly the night before but hadn't been sorted. The first night of our holiday I spent on the phone for hours trying to get someone to come out. Which cost me alot of money!! finally at 9.30pm after being sat in for hours a plumber arrived. he eventually left at 10.30pm our first night in Amsterdam was ruined, all our plans were cancelled and it wasn't fair at all. We spent alot of money on that trip and feel we should be given a refund for at least one nights stay as it was awful and I felt more stressed than I have done in a long time. I would appreciate it if you could get in contact with me to sort this out. "
1,Excellent people and home to stay with Losif and friends. Thanks for the hospitality.
1,"Very beautiful Room with sweet balcony. We enjoyed the stay very much. The bath was clean. 
Frank and his Family were very nice and helpful.
Would recommend!"
1,"Irene's apartment looks exactly how it is in the pictures. It was clean, cozy, and very comfortable (especially the bed; I slept like a baby on it)! It's located very close to Amsterdam central, but not close enough to be surrounded by tourists, which was great. We got to experience Amsterdam like locals do, and when we wanted to partake in the touristy attractions, we just took the trams. There's an AMAZING breakfast place right down the street from this apartment called ""Omelegg."" Best meal in Amsterdam for us!

Now for the negatives:

The bathroom floods. We had to use our towels on the last day, when we knew we didn't need them anymore, to mop up the floor. But before that last day, we couldn't sacrifice our towels because we needed them to shower. On those days, the flooded bathroom floor was pretty bad. When it's frigid outside, and you're stepping on a soaked wet floor, it's awful! But we've had this happen to us in 3 other countries. So, we don't really blame Irene for this. The design of many bathrooms abroad is just like this, it seems. We would recommend that the host probably provide some extra towels for this reason.

Now, the REAL reason we gave this only 4 stars was because we had so little direction with getting to the apartment. The instructions said to take the train to central station, and to take a tram to the apartment. That was it. Well, for people who don't know Amsterdam and are going for the first time, a little more detail is needed. We had to figure out the tram lines ourselves, in the rain, while we were freezing, in the dark, on the side of the road. It took us 2 hours to find the place after a very long airplane ride from the states, and we arrived wet, cold, and very stressed. The host said we should've called, but we did! Our phones did not have an international plan, but we stopped at a store, and the shopkeeper let us use his phone. There was no answer at the number provided! Also, we couldn't find #157 when we finally found the street. So, we started desperately ringing all the neighbors' doorbells to find the place. The host heard us speaking loudly to the neighbors, and luckily, she let us in. Turns out, the front door had just been painted, and the #157 on the front door had disappeared under the paint! Of course we couldn't find it!

In the future, the host should tell visitors specifically which tram to take to the apartment and how to get there. The number should also be on the door so that visitors know where to knock. Our first night in Amsterdam was nearly a disaster because of this issue. If this is fixed, the apartment is a great find."
1,"Great house in where everyone can feel like home. The host is very nice, helpful and answers immediately to all our questions we had. We had a great time. The location is very good and close to all the means of transportation."
1,"Sheila was an excellent host. The room looked exactly as listed and was very calm. In the comfy bed I slept awfully good . Wifi worked great. 
I'll definitely be back next year! Thank's Sheila"
1,"Excellent location right by the museums and the tram 5 line for easy access to the center. Be careful of taxi drivers, I got scammed on my first night. If you take a cab make sure it's legit with a running meter."
1,"Mirjam's place was perfect...exactly as advertised. Clean, quiet, and amazing hospitality. Very easy to get into the city by bus, and nice to have a quiet place at the end of the day. Would definitely stay here again!"
-1,No hot water the whole time was sad.
1,perfect location
1,"Great location with the daily market nearby, many restaurants and bars, lovely neighborhood stores, and walking distance to many of Amsterdam’s sights. The apartment is comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. Having 2 bathrooms is great. Would highly recommend this Airbnb for a group of 4-5. "
-1,"Well, that has been my worst Airbnb experience so far.
The stairs that lead to the flat are very narrow and abrupt. You can hardly go up and down with a mid-size luggage.
The stairs smell the hash all day long as the flat is just above a coffee shop.
There is no space in the bedrooms to store your stuff. No wardrobes or closets, no drawers. Nothing!!

We got one set of keys for 4 people. We asked for an additional one. The agency promised to bring it but we never got it!!!
The shower sewer was blocked and the water could barely go down the drain. We called the agency to repair it. But no one came!!!

To recap. A very bad experience."
1,"Fantastic host and great location with nearby store (aldi) and tram stop. Perfect place to come back to after a long day out.
PS would not recommend the nearby coffee shop as we feel we got scammed"
-1,"It's very tiny for three people. Don't think the room is possible to accommodate for three people actually. Moreover, the bedding sheets are stained and awful. Please mind the hygiene of the house when you rent it for people.
For those who are awared this, there is a post when you get out of the elevator stating their neighbours are not welcome tourists.
Though our stay is not nice as we thought, thanks Miek and Williem for the guidence."
1,"Very nice place, by bikes (included), Amsterdam’s center is only 15 minutes with no parking problem ! "
1,"The house was very welcoming and comfortable. It was perfect with our 2.5 year old. only thing to note is that there are many stairs and care needs to be taken with the child. There was access to many very useful amenities inside and outside and we had absolutely everything we needed and more. Jorgen's tips were extremely helpful, and the location on the north side suited us very well, especially in the very warm weather we encountered. Great value, great host, great location, perfekt with small children!"
1,"The flat was probably my most positive experience with Airbnb. I've had bad experiences staying in Amsterdam before, so I wanted a place that was comfortable and clean, yet centrally located. The flat is immaculate and beautiful. It is very near the museum square, yet just off on a quiet and relaxing street. Amsterdam can be crazy, especially during the time I stayed there. This flat ensured I had a comfortable, home-like place to come back to. The appliances are in perfect working condition. We were able to cook mussels and pasta and store a lot of food. It was a wonderful stay and I will definitely be back!"
-1,"It was my first bad experience with airbnb. The apartment was ok and area is good too. It was mainly the lack of cleanliness (bed sheets, shower mainly) and the slow reponse from the host, two days to change bedsheets. Jort apologized and left a bottle of wine which was a nice detail."
1,We really enjoyed our stay and the local tips took us to some really interesting places away from the tourist areas. Would definitely recommend a stay on this lovely little boat. 
-1,"the house was so dirty we refused to stay, there is one bed not 4, and was offered a dirty bed with not clean covers if I wanted a second, it was actually disgusting I didn't want to even sit down. well I didn't just awful how they live, also the room worth dirty covers had been slept in and smoked in was awful and I'm surprised I didn't throw up entering the house, clutter everywhere and sofa bed take a look at the matress it's brown! I would t let my dogs sleep here, nasty!!!!! wish I took pics but wanted to get out asap"
-1,"We easily found the apartment per the instructions,  as no one was available to meet us. It is very easy to reach via the tram. Per previous comments, the Dutch stairs are definitely a consideration if you have luggage or any other issues. They are almost vertical and extremely narrow. Luckily we managed.  The apartment is essentially pictured (an idyllic view from all windows and balcony) as advertised but the chair has a major tear down the center now and the couch covered with a throw. The apartment needs sorely to be painted and many holes from missing pictures filled. There was no free closet space (nor drawers), as it was filled with a mattress and bedding that I had to remove. Be forewarned that you can hear all street noise since the bedroom is on the street and walking above your head (if anyone is home) since it is an old Bldg. It's not like NY noise but bring earplugs in case you want to sleep late. There was a minor issue with three burned light bulbs which took a couple of days to resolve, as Martijn was away and I thought not urgent enough to phone him. There was an issue with the shower backing up. I wish we had known about the delicate nature of the plumbing earlier. Martijn was absolutely apologetic and helpful with all issues encountered,  but I was disappointed with the overall condition of the lodging."
0,"Location :10/10
Facilities: 5/10
Connectivity:9/10
Perfect for one person max of 2, Only trouble faced is to climb too many stairs especially if you have luggage or if your old I would certainly not recommend this stay .For young travelers it's perfect .Floors makes a lot of noise and ventilation in the room is an issue because windows cannot be opened completely.

The host was sweet enough to fix a fan knowing we were feeling hot "
0,"Communication was good, although the lock check in can be a little difficult to figure out. The downside was a broken towel rack that made an awful clanging noise throughout the night."
1,Great place and really conveniently located. Was able to walk home later that evening with no problem. Will definitely book again next time I am in Amsterdam 👍
1,"I had some friends from Vancouver visiting me on a trip to Europe and we had the great opportunity to stay at Hugo's truly awesome place. We have been greeted with wonderful sunshine, so we could have our drinks at the rooftop terrace.
The place is bright, airy and contemporary, has everything you could possibly ask for and the location is brilliant. We loved it!
It is certainly one of the best places you can rent in Amsterdam. After having had quite a few bad experiences there before, Hugo's place is a truly lovely and positive experience.
We've found a private Canal tour operator ( Those Dam Boat guys), who showed us Amsterdam from a total different side and we had dinner at Restaurant De Kas, which has been fantastic.
Thank you Hugo for your hospitality, we will certainly be back and you have a fanclub in Canada now! "
1,Great find in a city short on accommodations.
-1,"I had a very bad experience with renting this Airbnb, the host was late a couple of hours for the checkin time even though it was ar 5PM in the first place, the internet connection is horrible and they make you pay for a cleaning service that you do not see! Furthermore, they have ""strict rules"" and expect you to follow yet they don't follow them their selves. "
0,"Nice room, awful floor."
0,"The apt is wonderfully located close to Amsterdam Centraal & walking distance to most everything in the city. We were a party of 4 staying in apt 3. My sister & brother arrived first; found Jan waiting in the cafe for us. He said the apt was almost done being cleaned & would be ready in 30 mins. After my husband & I arrived shortly thereafter, we ordered coffees & waited. Jan never returned. So I never met him. We probably waited 2 hrs when I finally asked the bartender about the apt. He came over within 5 mins with the keys. The whole process seemed odd. That same bartender helped carry 1 of our suitcases up the very steep & narrow stairs. But that's just how the buildings are in Amsterdam. You quickly learn how to navigate those fun stairs! The apt. itself is very spacious; great for a larger family with very comfortable beds. We loved that the toilet was separate from the shower/bath area, however, the water pressure in the shower was awful. It was almost impossible to shower. The couch in the living area can definitely use a cleaning; it was quite dirty. Wi-fi was available, but irregular; and it only worked in the living area, not in the bedrooms, which was frustrating. The walls are thin so you can hear people in apt. 4, especially when they are walking up the stairs to their unit. I was also surprised that there was no sort of guidebook in the unit; no instructions, details, suggestions on what to do; nothing. Jan/Esther never checked in on us during our stay. We did reach out asking about taxi/Uber service back to the airport and Jan's response was immediate and helpful. The kitchen is well stocked, the bath towels were soft and smelled fresh, the bedding was wonderful. Even with cold, rainy weather, we had a great time in Amsterdam. "
1,"Bryan was simply amazing, from the moment we stepped in Amsterdam airport he was already guiding us through the fastest and cheapest way to get to his apartment. I would recommend this listing and any other listings he may have. Also this small condo had very steep steps as described in the listing: we had to see for ourselves and I would not recommend big and heavy suitcases. Bryan was nice enough to help us carry the suitcases upstairs and on top of that he came back for the checkout and helped us carry them back down. Great host and great place!!!"
1,"Generally good communication between the hosts. We were let in by the cleaner as  we were earlier than usual for check in. The flat is pretty incredible, in fact one of the best conditions I've ever stayed in at aBnB. Just watch out for the steep Dutch stairs before you get to the flat door! The photos are exactly what you should expect from the flat - clean modern and well designed. Kudos to the designers for making the fire extinguisher feel like a designer item! 
Now for the short number of issues: The flat is very obviously designed for short stay travellers. There's no food cupboard as such, and therefore no inclusive tea / milk / sugar etc which to me at least, is a welcome necessary to every AirBnB. Everyone who stayed in the flat thought so too which is ashame.
This issue is less to do with the flat / management, but there were an awful amount of mosquitos in both bedrooms at night. Perhaps it was the time of year or temperature, but do make sure you keep the windows closed and the air con on or face stings and itchiness for days to come.
Despite this, I would stay here again as the flat itself is lovely and the design is just to my tastes. Thank you for a pleasant stay."
1,"Great place, even better hosts! Avishai and Katjalisa made us feel at home and went beyond expectations when showing their warmth and hospitality. Room is well decorated, clean and bright, with a waterview! Also parking was perfect in the garage, most definitely recommended. Will definitely stay there again! "
-1,"BEWARE of check-in process. Oscar was messaging us as if he was in Amsterdam waiting to meet us to hand over the keys. Even saying ""I will meet you there at 6pm"", when in fact, we were kept waiting for over an hour and Oscar was not replying to any of his messages, nor did his phone work – making us think that we were getting scammed. Finally after waiting for an hour, his nephews showed up to give us the keys and advised us that Oscar was in fact, on holiday! So he was basically messaging us copy & pasted messages and saying he would meet us to arrange check-in when he wasn't even in the city! Not even an apology from him when I expressed my disappointment, but instead ANOTHER copy & pasted message saying he ""hopes we are enjoying our trip"" when failing to address the issues raised before. I would not recommend Oscar as a host due to his poor communication and blatant lack of professionalism. Also the place is very nice and in a great area, however it is not worth the price as I've had much better on Airbnb for cheaper. I would look elsewhere or find another host in the same area next time."
1,"Steven and Alana were amazing hosts, though we never actually met face to face. how could they be so amazing if you never meet them in person? well let me tell you... for starters, i was looking for a place in amsterdam at the last minute (as in the day before i needed it). Steven and Alana got back to me almost immediately. They also went out of their way to send me a detailed list of places to eat at, as i had asked for a recommendation (not to mention a map they created to show us where we could find coffee shops, museums, heineken, and more). when we arrived at the apartment, they had even purchased eggs and bacon for us to eat the next morning. then when we were going to leave, my girlfriend accidentally left a bag in the apartment after we had already locked the keys inside. i called Alana, and she immediately had a friend come out to the house to let us in. we couldn't have asked for better hosts!
The apartment is almost as amazing as its' owners! it is very modern and comfortable with everything you need for a nice, but very affordable stay in amsterdam. the pictures are very accurate, unlike those people who post only pictures of the good things but then leave out pictures that show you an awful bedroom or kitchen or something. the balcony/patio was cozy with a very nice garden view. the location was also great! a bit of a long walk to say the red light district, but if you rent a bike, everything is very accessible. heineken: 5 minutes... van gogh museum: 5 minutes... city center: 10-15 minutes... anne frank house: 20 minutes.
I would HIGHLY recommend Steven and Alana's Amsterdam apartment for rent! I had a great all-round experience and will look to see if the apartment is available again the next time i am going back to amsterdam."
1,The apartment and situation was very good. All arrangement by hostess was so marvelous. Thanks awfully. Everything was complete.
1,"Carolinas apartment is just as lovely as it's shown in the pictures. My best friend and I very enjoyed our short stay at Carolinas place, the neighborhood seemed nice and the city center can be reached within 15 min by bus.  We had a great time! We can't wait for our next visit! :)"
0,"This is a nice apt with lots of light and high ceilings.  The location is a pretty residential neighborhood. The bed is comfy.  It's removed from centrum area though if that is important to you. Transportation is amazing in Amsterdam so it's an easy half hr. by tram.
 We couldn't find a coffee maker and I love my coffee in the a.m.!  Bring a hair dryer if you need one.
The internet password did not work for us which was frustrating because I use it for business while travelling.
Our only big complaint was checking in was a really bad experience for us. My fault for not reading all emails in their entirety because the key to get in was off site....and half an hour away, back to where we had come from!  It was late, my phone battery died, the information line we had was only in Dutch, we were dragging our luggage around and the trams were about to stop running for the night.... We've stayed at many Airbnb's and the host was always present or the key was on lockbox at the house. It was not stated in the listing that it was offsite so we were clueless. This is my fault for not paying closer attention.  So as long as you are aware of this and read your emails....you should be okay. 
On the other hand...the people that work at the Papa John's on the corner are so very nice and helpful and there's a nice pub called Ronie's up on the main street."
0,"Lasha's place was a little further out of the city centre than I had expected, but this was no problem thanks to the good tram connection... He wasn't there personally during the three days I stayed, but a lovely friend of his was (Lela). I wasn't aware of this until meeting her the next day, so this was a little confusing... It was a bit of a project to get the key (a friend of mine picked it up from Lela somewhere) but it all worked out, and she seemed really nice, although we didn't talk much. I can't say the place was clean (at all), but the room was okay, considering the price. There was an awful cat smell too. So if staying at a clean place is a priority for you, I wouldn't exactly recommend it. "
-1,"Julie was nice host but Ithink we had some mis understanding for check in and during our messages. First this place is ok for single person, but not for couple, may be for two friends it is ok.  But later when she is giving the information about house and keys.  she is behaving a bit cold and trying to taunt "" which country are you from,  keys are same"" this is when I asked about how to use the main door key.  and later when she knows that we are tired and had some late activity in Amsterdam. she still listening some vedio on loud noise,might be in that way she is asking us to leave. but we could go as we have the night tour at 9pm.  So this is our lowest time in her place and Also not so welcoming , our original booking was cancelled so we booked her place at last moment. and we paid 120usd which is not this kind of experience"
1,"Marieke is a fantastic host, in every moment she answered to all our questions quickly. The appartement its clean and full equiped, perfect to travel in pairs, in the same neighbourhoods there is a supermarket, a pharmacy, etc. its near to the center, 20 min approx in bus. 
Without doubts, a place to repeat another time."
1,"Great location. So close to a lot of amazing things and not an awful walk to central Amsterdam (20 mins). The place is small but with everything to do in Amsterdam, we didn’t spend much time there. The place seems to be a lived-in space that is rented out, so it was a little untidy. Bed is super comfortable."
1,"I don't give much feed back unless I'm really really disappointed or if I'm very happy. On this case the accommodation and host need highly praising. The house and the location is perfect, picturesque. You are right in the centre literally 5mins brisk walk from the station even though your in the centre your a street or two away from the hustle and bustle there's no seedyness and crowds of people on your doorstep so you feel pretty safe. The house it's self is beautiful with modern and vintage elements it's extremely clean and tidy. The views are great and you are near very nice bars and restaurants. I will definitely stay here again and again and tell my friends to do so also. "
-1,"We have been very disappointed with the apartment and we would never rent it again.
The apartment was dirty, dusty (and the dust has been there for a long time), very humid and with a very strong smell of mold.
We also found hairs in our bed sheets.
When we wrote to the owner to ask for a cleaning, the first answer was a standard marketing e-mail ignoring our question.
He only offered a cleaning service on the last day of our stay, which was already too late.
Considering the high level of the price, such a situation is unacceptable."
-1,"The place is central and properly furnished. End of the good news. It's tiny and suffocating and awfully expensive compared to what it offers. If you don't like to live in a place where all the windows have been sealed shut and where the promised open space is not accessible, keep on looking for your accommodation in Amsterdam."
1,"Moira's apartment is very convenient for traveling in and around Amsterdam and Moira offers great advise for local restaurants and tourist sites. Renting nearby and riding through Amsterdam was lovely! We enjoyed the cozy apartment and balcony and found the home quite comfortable for our needs. Moira was very easy to reach and super responsive. We kept our distance from Chili and when she seemed to still be anxious about our presence, Moira came to help immediately! (If you like cats I wouldn't come here expecting to make a new friend, Chili is elusive and antisocial, but she is adorable to look at.) Overall, this home was a budget-friendly and cozy launching point for our adventures in Amsterdam. Thanks for having us, Moira!"
1,"If there was 6 stars I’d give this place exactly that. The extra star comes from the unique touches, the stylish space, and the lovely cat that is Mario. 

Exactly described as pictures(minus the outside patio table) and the layout was tasteful.
Hajo was a fantastic host with great communication ahead of time, prepared maps for key spots nearby, and an art filled home. 

Loved the stay and would come back and recommend 100%."
1,"Emil went out of his way to pick us up from the Centraal Station and drop us there when we left. He took care of us really well by providing breakfast and towels for us to make our stay as cosy as comfortable as possible. The pictures are true and accurate. He leaves us on our own most of the time but was very helpful when we needed help.

The only downside is that the location is pretty far from the city centre. "
-1,"Where to begin...John is a scammer and is currently trying to take $1,200 from us. At the time of this review we are currently going through the resolution centre to refuse his request.

He has requested $1,200 on the basis of a company that has quoted ""miscellaneous"" damages to his home. The photos that have been shared with Airbnb are three photos of a small puddle of water, some wine on a metal radiator, and some wine on a welcome mat. Apparently all those things cost him $1,200 in repairs. Repairs which the company could not even specify. John seems to think that by providing the receipt in Dutch that we are not able to enter it into (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Translate nor would we submit it to Airbnb which he forgot to do twice in his claims.

We have provided John very simple instructions that a child could follow, on how to clean up the ""damages"". We hope our fellow customers take this warning very seriously and stay away. We trust that Airbnb will continue their investigation and shut him down."
1,Nice flat I strongly recommend Nick really nice guy. the room was good in a good area well communicated.
1,"Just want to thank you Andrea for your hospitality and valuable information that made my stay in Amsterdam exciting and fulfilling, for the meal on my arrival and detailed information and willingness to go out of your way, and the pleasant ambience and  room which felt like a home away from home. Looking forward to coming again in the future. "
1,"We had a great time staying at Rik's apartment. Everything was as described, the flat is great and very clean. Very pretty street, rather quiet neighborhood but a lot of sights and things to do in walking distance. Rik was a great host and helped us with everything. Easy and perfect for a couple/solo traveller! Definitely recommending this place!"
-1,"Unfortunately, we would have been better off staying at a hotel. It wasn’t mentioned in the description that the hosts also live in the apartment; therefore, the closet and cabinets all have their personal belongings. It was difficult to get comfortable and use the space because it was already packed and filled with their clothes and other personal items. We actually thought this was a “rental” and not just us staying at someone’s home. True we had the apartment to ourselves but we couldn’t get comfortable because the apartment was obviously currently lived in. It’s odd to be surrounded with other people’s personal stuff. We actually thought this was strictly a “rental” apartment. The photos and description doesn’t match what we received. Plus, the towels had awful smell. Disappointing."
0,"The apartment is very convenient as it is placed in the center of the city. It's close to everything and you can go any place just by walking. Also, it has a private bathroom and a small fridge, which we found very helpful. Nevertheless, the room was not really clean at all. The floor and the furniture were dusty, and the bed linen did not feel too fresh either. I suffer from allergic issues with dust and I had a bad experience trying to catch sleep. In addition, the room is not on the same floor as the whole apartment. You have to walk to a lot of steep stairs to get there (and there is no other way to get in). Also, the building was very old and we could not find lights in the hallway. The walls felt very old as well, as we could hear everything from our ""neighbors"" (we're not sure where the sound came from). The heating also made weird sounds and some nights it even woke us up.
We didn't got to know Jasper (the owner), but we met Ruben, and he was very nice -he even let us check in earlier without any problem. Communication was fine.

In conclusion, the apartement is quite well for it's price as it's very well placed and it has several facilities but it was worse than I expected."
-1,"I do not recommend this apartment. 
1. The time of check-in was 6:00p.m. I asked the host more early time but it was denied.
2. The light in living room went out when we arrived there. So we had to stay in the dark. After we complained, the host fixed them. 
3. There were 2 bed rooms. But we could use only 1 bed room because the host put all stuffs in another room. This was not notified to us before.
4. Fridge and closets were full of host's ones. So we could not use them. This was also not notified before.
5. The apartment was not safe. The electric wire was  exposed out. If a child touch it, it can cause a serious problem. 

For these reason, I do not recommend this apartment. "
0,"Nice studio, although it does not accomodate 4 people as listed (well, not if you do not bring air beds and refrain from snoring). Some little things could use retouching but overall it is a very nice place to stay and it is a nice walk through the park to the shopping centre. Make sure you rent a bike when visiting this part of Amsterdam: the area just north of the ring road is gorgeous and impossible to visit without your own 2-wheel pedal-powered transport."
1,"That was the best time of the year! Though, Carolina was in a trip, she left us a map with some tips and her friend Nnanna to whom I would like to say a special thanks, also told us a lot about Amsterdam, how people live here and was really hospitable and open.
The nearby areas are so cosy, quite and home-like, that it was a pleasure to come back there from the city walking (15 minutes from the central station and you are back!). Supermarkets are just about 5-7 minutes walk from a place in a new area.  

Thank you a lot for the place and hope we will be able to visit you in future again !"
1,"Couldn't have wished for a better place to celebrate my birthday. Wonderful hosts, wine and flowers when we arrived. Made us feel very welcome in their home. Take their advice on where to eat and things to do. I did and was never disappointed. Watch the world go by just outside in one of the best locations in Amsterdam. Very special place. Wouldn't recommend anywhere else in Amsterdam if you want to be central but without the crowds."
1,"Lizet’s place is an absolute dream! Enough space to tuck away after running around the city all day. She was the perfect balance of attentive and laid back and the room had everything we needed - a kettle, a nice wee fridge, and a beautiful terrace that we never wanted to leave! Highly recommend. "
1,"We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam. The room is very spaceous and comfortable. Our hosts were very kind, relaxed and helpfull. Although not exactly centrally located there is a bus connection just around the corner and you can reach Amsterdam central station in about 15 min. even at night. 
So if you are looking for a cozy accomodation in a quiet neighbourhood this is the place to be. 
Thank you very much for this wonderfull weekend."
-1,I hate writing negative reviews. But I must be truthful about my stay. We took a 18 day European holiday and stayed at this Flat for 2 days. It was the most expensive 3 times the price of the others. What was an awful experience.....The bed didn't have any sheets on the bed or pillows. Had to sleep on a mattress and comforter.  And not one towel! Had to use my shirt to dry off! We contacted the host all weekend and not one response until checkout. Very hard having a nice stay with these problems. These could have been fixed with a simple reply back. And have the cleaning service bring the towels and sheets back to the flat. The stairs are super super steep. And you hear the neighbors talking all day.....The roof area is nice.......Sorry I just had to be honest about my stay.
-1,"This place is ok but the bathroom is dirty and need maintenance work, I was so disappointed when I got there. Also the host asked me to text her a day before my arrival and in my arrival day so she won't be late but sadly she was late and not on time. Moreover I paid for 3 guests and they didn't provide extra sheets. It's such a bad experience I will never book there again :("
1,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay! The boat is even better than we expected. Check in was very easy, Friso’s friend showed us around, let us drop our bags and check in early.

The boat was very clean and had everything we needed. Everything in the boat is to a very high standard, the interior is beautiful and very homely.  The floating terrace is so lovely, we sat out there and had breakfast and fed the ducks! Also the bed in the boat was extremely comfortable!

Great location also, coffee shops, restaurants and supermarket a couple of minutes walk around the corner. The boat is about a 10-15 minute cycle ride to central station and there is a tram stop a 2 minute walk away. For us the location was perfect.

We did not want to leave and staying here made our trip extra special. I would not hesitate to recommend staying here.  Thank you Friso for an amazing stay- and also for the prosecco and waffles waiting for us on arrival!"
1,"Andrea was very nice host and the house was as described in the pictures. We enjoyed our stay in amsterdam. The house is very close to metro station n bus stop, the room was clean."
-1,"The room was not exactly like the description. It was not private room. There was another room that was rented by a man from Germany connected to my room and only separated by a curtain. When I ask for another room, Mirab's cousin gave me a kind of storeroom that was quite awful with hole at the roof and a lot of stuff inside. I ended up moved to hostel and lost my money for this. Overall, I was really disappointed."
1,"We were two students from Austria in need of a comfortable studio for a couple of days. Judit has welcomed us punctual and very warmly. She always responded quickly and the booking process itself was as easy and uncomplicated as expected. 
The studio fulfills every need of a short-term traveller. Furnished kitchen, clean bathroom, balcony, double-bed, TV, WIFI, sofa, etc. The bus in front of the apartment door takes you to the central station within 15 minutes and to a mall within 3 minutes. 
We warmly recommend Judit as a host and her studio. "
1,"This is a wonderful opportunity to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. Literally could not be better placed. The apartment is so beautiful and stylish, the pictures don't quite do it justice! Very cosy, and restaurants and bars and shops right outside your door. We particularly liked the nearby farmer's market on the saturday. Wietseke was away, but her dad was so helpful and kind, giving us local tips and advice. We loved relaxed and kind Dutch hospitality. And our two year old loved scampering around the apartment. Thanks for everything! Will probably stay again if they will have us!"
1,"The place was awesome and Iosif was also a very good host! He and his friend, Adrian were very very nice people! They really spent time to talk to us and make us feel comfortable!  We also felt very welcomed by them which made our stay in their place very good! They also allowed us to use all the things in their kitchen when we wanted to cook, and they even gave us tea! The place was also very clean and comfortable to stay in. Place is maybe around 20-30 mins by subway to the city center but the place is in a very quiet neighborhood. Also if you decide to not use the room to sleep, their living room is also pretty spacious. :) Would definitely recommend Iosif's place! Loved our stay in Amsterdam also because of him!"
1,An amazing stay. Beautiful space in the perfect location. Elly and Pieter were so helpful and were really flexible with all the travel delays we experienced. Communication was exceptional. Can’t recommend Yanna’s place enough. Thank you!
1,"It was my first time staying with Airbnb, a little bit nervous for the previous other two host canceled my booking with no reason. 

But Franz and Maria were amazing. Their warm welcome really made me feel so comfortable. They were super friendly, and helpful. The challenges for me were the stairs - 3rd floor with giant luggage was a big deal, and the dog, Leica - i had bad experience with dog when I was kid, rarely get along well with dogs, so I tend to avoid them. But the challenges were solved, Franz and Maria help me with Leica, and they even help me with my giant luggage upstairs - and again, downstairs. 

Their hospitality, their house, the room, the facilities, were all beyond expectation. The house itself was really close to metro station, easily get to everywhere. The bed was super comfy, room (and the bathroom) was lovely. The welcome chocolate and tea was delicious. I cant find the hairdryer, but was no big deal. 

Everything were just sooo perfect, even the books inside the bedroom were really tempting. If only I have more time to spend enjoying the room (and books), I think I would miss the city :D

Thank you so much Franz and Maria, you were both super great host :)"
1,"Great stay at Rob's apartment, he was there for us when we arrived and showed us round the apartment.

The apartment itself was well equipped, clean and really lovely. Perfect for what we needed! 

It's location is also great, supermarkets near by and the tram station also very close - although we didn't really use this as there were the two bikes (which saved us around 60 euros for if we were to hire).

Overall great stay, great city and friendly host.

Thanks Rob - enjoy the beers :)"
1,"Great location, stylish and simple yet very cosy room with a lovely balcony which made you feel at home - great restaurant recommendations & very responsive. Would highly recommend booking here if you can!"
-1,"The place was well located, but it wasn't clean, the bed sheets smelled awful, the bathroom and the kitchen sink was dirty, the fridge.. Do not open it. The host was communicative and ok but he gave us another apartment at the beginning (a smaller one that we didn't choose or seen before in pictures, I understand it was a mistake)"
1,"Excellent apartment in a fantastic location, close to everything. Great for two people, but probably no more than that. PLEASE NOTE that the apartment is at the top of three flights of very steep stairs (two of them circular), so if you have any concerns about stairs at all perhaps look for a unit on a lower level. 

Check-in was easy; we only had to wait a few minutes for someone from Iambnb to come from their office down the street to let us in. (Though...I did not receive a response to my text saying we had arrived, which may have been an issue with my phone.) The main office is at 61 Kerkstraat, so if you can't reach someone by phone when you arrive, or if you have any problems, it's a short walk from the apartment. 

The wi-fi was a little wonky, but we could access the network from other Iambnb apartments in the building whenever there was a connection problem. 

Be sure to use the over-the-stove fan if you are cooking ANYTHING, as the smoke detectors are very, very sensitive.

The bed is not the most comfortable, but it wasn't too bad (and I have back problems, so if I'm not complaining too loudly it can't have been awful). 

A final suggestion: I can DEFINITELY recommend the Tinker cab service that is mentioned on the Iambnb site. It turned out to be cheaper than train tickets into town and back for two people, was a shorter trip, and worked exactly as promised."
-1,"It's in a good location and offers great views of the city. It's clean and well maintained. You do pay a lot more than you would normally for a place like this under a normal tenancy (it's maybe worth about 400 euros per month, at a push, mainly because of location).

The room itself is very small, just a dorm really. There is a common area but it is locked and inaccessible so not usable as such. The kitchen is clean but lacks an oven and the cooker plates take a bit of getting used to to operate (instructions are necessary or you will be unable to turn it on, ask a flatmate). There is very little in the way of cutlery so bring your own. There are 2 bins in the kitchen but Priscilla expects you to only use them for food waste, so if you do have trash yourself you need to keep it in your room and dispose of it in a public bin in the street. There is no bin/trashcan in your room. 

In the summer the rooms can get very hot because they are at the top of the building, so bring a fan or you will literally lie in your bed sweating. It's probably not even worth staying here when the weather is hot to be honest.

There is no parking anywhere nearby, the nearest parking is about 20mins walk away. Or you can pay about 30 euros a day to park on the street. You cannot get residency here.

The internet is truly awful. At peak times something like YouTube is pretty much unwatchable.

The fridge provided in your room is very small, barely enough for more than a couple of days worth of food. You can't leave food in the kitchen as Priscilla tells everyone that if it is left in the kitchen cupboards it is for everyone, so you need to use your wardrobe instead.

The lighting in the room is quite dim, not even 40watt I'd say.

Overall I would not recommend this place. It is neither a room in someones house nor a B&B type room. It is a very small dorm room, overpriced for what it is and made to look sufficient in the photos. Not a pleasant place to stay, just convenient for those looking for a good location and need little other than a place to sleep."
1,"Communication: Awesome
Flat: Awesome
Hosts: Awesome

It was a really nice stay, even if the weather was awful, it was totally fine for us to stay in the flat cause it was really cozy inside :)

Can definitely recommend this Airbnb!"
1,"Lovely flat and location! When we arrived we didn't have cell service to coordinate meeting with Jeanine (or as it turned out, her husband) to get into the flat (we hadn't prearranged a specific time 'cause we didn't know what train we'd be on) but through a process of trial and error and randomly available wifi we were able to figure it out. Jeanine's husband was waiting for us and gave us a cursory tour. Jeanine had left us a list of instructions/recommendations and a lovely chocolate bar. Not in a touristy area but easy to find just a few blocks from the Weesperplein metro station (which itself is just 3 stops from Centraal Station) though the airbnb map is a bit misleading as to exact location (luckily we mapped it in advance). Also near a small grocery and tram stops and there was a laundry not too far away (Laundry Club--map it). And it's very easy to walk/take a tram/metro to the more popular/crowded areas. There's a nice little Italian restaurant & a fondue restaurant on the corner and a fabulous pizza joint just a block further down the street. The flat itself is charming and elegant--almost intimidatingly so: you don't want to spill your wine here! ;-) Some things you should know (if you haven't figured it out from pics or other reviews): it's on 3 half levels--the bedroom is below, the living room on the street level (but it's not a street, it's a quiet courtyard/dead-end), and bath/kitchen/dining room on the 3rd level.  The kitchen is well equipped, the bathroom less so. The bed is two twins pushed together so there's that crack in the middle. And per usual in this part of the world, the bed has a bottom sheet and a down comforter on top--no top sheet or light blanket available and small bath towels and no wash cloths.  It has radiant heat, but we couldn't figure out how to adjust it. This seems to be Jeanine's home (or second home) as there's a lot of stuff there, food in the fridge and cupboards, etc. The only negative for us was the lack of any sort of hooks or hangers to hang clothes or damp towels to dry on: there was a padlock on the closets and no other place to unpack/hang anything other than over the back of a chair. And no hair dryer--first place I've ever stayed that didn't provide a hair dryer and it was awfully cool and damp to go out with wet hair.  Those issues wouldn't keep me from staying there again, but be prepared. Also if you are comfortable riding, rent a bike! Great way to explore Amsterdam (try Starbikes if you don't want a bike that screams ""watch out, I'm a tourist on a bike). "
1,"Perfect place!
Perfect hosts!
Klaas,s beauty, goodness, intelligence, and ease shown through his home.
We got to know him personally by way of an wonderful canal tour he provided.
He is amazing and we will never forget him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
-1,"The Worst airbnb ever in my life! What you see in the photos is absolutely not what you find in real. The room is 2,5m x 2m. The fun is that you have a balcony in the room but you can't reach it cos the bed is very pressed against the two walls,so you just can walk on the bed for exit,ridiculous! There are no sockets,everywhere,you can't charge your phone or use no technologies! I've never seen so much dirty in my life: the dust was tall 3cm from the ground, everywhere. you can't cook cos there are no pots and dishes are so dirty! You can't sit in bathroom because of the door banging against your knees. The flat is messy,dirty and really so far from the city,you take so long for go downtown. i think they never clean inside since 3months and it's funny cos you have to pay 25€ extra for cleaning services. Hosts are unpleasant so we couldn't ask any informations. in the garden there's a couch covered of cigarettes and rain. In the house there's not just you but other people that shout and party and can enter when and how they want! they also accused us to stole food from the fridge! really a bad experience, i hope nobody happen what happened to us! For more info in details and photos of what we found in the flat,please contact me in private"
1,"Andrea was a very nice host. We arrived her place late and went the wrong way, but she was very kindly and pick us up. Besides, she provide much information about travel in Amsterdam, and help us print tickets out. she is so friendly. Our room was nice, comfortable, and clean. If you are finding a place to stay in Amsterdam, I will definitely recommend it!"
-1,"I have to say that we were left a bit disappointed by this experience.  When we arrived and called Peter an hour before check in he seemed very rushed and asked us to get there as soon as possible.  When we arrived i noticed that the bathrooms did not have any toilet paper...when i pointed this out Peter went out to get some but seemed quite put out.  The bathrooms did not have any amenities like shampoo etc.  We each received 1 towel and one hand towel.  This was to be used for the week. There is a washer but no dryer..so we felt an extra set of towels should have been available.  The worst was the situation in the only full bath.  The mold in the shower and growing on the bathroom ceiling was unbelievable...really beyond anything acceptable. 
"
1,"Judit was responsive and helpful in preparation for our visit. Her sister Anna facilitated our entry into the apartment eventhough we arrived much later than planned. The studio was clean, and as pictured on the photo. The location was convenient for us visiting friends and family nearby, and easy access by bus to Amsterdam Central Station. The bathroom is small and very old but clean. The balcony is a plus. The kitchen is relatively well equipped and it was really nice to find the basics such as salt, pepper and washing liquid available. The pullout bed is somewhat narrow and not that comfortable. Overall, a good experience for a reasonable price. "
1,"Pasquale wasn't available when i arrived in the country, but her friend Juul came and was really nice and on time so she could show me the apartment and everything. She was also available anytime if i had questions and really helpful on certain points. (I suppose Pasquale does so when she's in town).

The apartment was great, really perfect size for solo or couple of travelers. It has all that u need. The only thing is i had to buy toilet paper and there wasn't any shampoo. As a ""carry-on"" traveler, i don't wanna bring all the ""liquids"" with me so i look for places that offer the basic toilet stuff.

But anyway, the place is close to everything, in a really nice neighborhood and 5 minutes walk from ""Muiderpoort Station"" which leads you anywhere in the country or in town. You also get the trams and buses that are as close as the station.

Pasquale left a little notebook on the kitchen table, which contains every cool place (in her point of view) and directions or specifications for grocery stores, or others important places. I've tried a few of the restaurants, and she was RIGHT! Pasquale sure knows her neighborhood pretty well.

The only negative point i could say is that if you go there to relax on evening night in the living room or on the balcony (which was not my goal lol) you will be a little disappointed because there's a park just in front and it gets pretty noisy on the evenings when the kids start to play and yell for the next 2-3 hours sometimes. There was also lots of noise on the street by the bedroom's windows. I had to keep the windows open 'cuz it was pretty hot in the apartment, so my sleep wasn't really good. But after all, you don't go on a holiday to stay in the apartment... so the noise... not that much of a problem for me! 

In short, Pasquale's place is a really comfy apartment which has all that you need and where i'd go back anytime, 'cuz it's got a great value when you compare quality/price.

Thanks Pasquale and Juul :)"
1,"Jorgen was extremely helpful with the area and patient with us due to our delayed flight. He was flexible with our unique check in and check out times.

The apartment is in a great location, close to the train and all the action of the Amsterdam. "
-1,The photos are misleading. The room that we got was very congested with no space to keep luggage. Not recommended for couples. Solo travellers can still adjust. Moreover room was separate on the other side of public corridor. We had to cross this public corridor where stairs are there to go to bathroom and kitchen. We felt awkward. Bathroom was even more congested where you can't even stretch your hands. The kitchen was also not kept proper. Bad experience all-over.
-1,"The owner has a cat that does not like to travel, therefore she may ask you at the last minute if she can leave the cat in the apartment with you. We agreed to this thinking that she would at least arrange to keep the cat off the furniture (ie; beds, tables, bathroom linens, kitchen counters, etc.) and in it's own area, since we were traveling with our dog. This was not the case. The sheets were trodden on and mussed up by the cat. There were dead plants around the living area (not just decoratively dried). There was trash on the deck and yard. The noise from the street was awful all night, bring earplugs! The bathroom and shower functioned, but the drain in the shower did not. The light bulbs and their wires are bare or wrapped in tinfoil. The ""artwork"" is sexual and can be offensive. The furniture is not always sturdy, even if it does look like it could be cute antiques. Be careful when opening doors, as they could contain everything she wanted unseen crammed in there waiting to fall out. Save your money or spend as much time as you can out of the house. Enjoy the Foodhallen nearby, or invest in the couple blocks walk to the Vondelpark."
1,"We were so glad that we choose to stay a night in Thea place. It was a really really nice and cozy place, it make us feel like we are home when we enter the house :) even though we did not meet Thea in person however her mother is at home welcome us with the greatest smile and she was really amazing, friendly and lovely by providing us a lot of information to the city and places to visit. We are so regret that wr only stay for one night but if we got another chance to visit Amsterdam again , Thea place is definitely the top choice ! Highly recommended !"
1,"I enjoyed staying at Mirjam's.  She was a good host, her apartment was cute and very clean. She was also helpful and non-intrusive.  I'd stay again.  Thanks!"
1,Thank you very much for the great accommodation!  We felt very comfortable and everything was basically fine and exactly as we had imagined. We really can recommend this accommodation! 🙂 
1,"Friso’s houseboat was the perfect place for us during our stay in Amsterdam. The description is accurate and the boat itself is as pictured. Friso has a book of local interests that we referred to every day before we headed out to explore. We were able to explore  the entire city on foot with ease, but if you want to use public transportation that is right there too. I would recommend Friso’s houseboat to anyone that wants a safe, quiet and beautifully appointed place to stay while visiting this fantastic city. "
-1,"I can not believe the previous reviews??? did they stay somewhere else?
It was not clean(dirty), the building was outworn. The sealing was falling down, was not painted for a long period of time, and no breakfast.
Downstairs the smell was awful....cats.

Sorry Jan, you were nice but the stay was NOT!  It was not worth it (202 euro for 3 persons!)"
-1,"I gave it a 2 star mainly because when I contacted the host 1 week before to arrange a time of arrival, I did not get a response back for 3 days. This is after a couple of emails and phone calls. Eventually she did txt me to say that a property manager will contact me. Which I also had to wait another day in a half for. Those first 3 days with no contact from owner was awful. Bad service. The apartment itself was average. Pictures look better than in real life. Like the other reviews say, it needs a cleaning and some touching up. The tv (cable) didn't work and the wifi does not work in the upstairs bedrooms. Some positives are that there is everything you need in the way of pots, pans, etc. although they can definitely use a new set of towels. They are at least 15 years old. The big positive is the location. It is in a great location which is hard to beat. Overall, it is a nice house, but pity that it looks tired and needs some care put into it. If there was good communication from the start I would of had a better feeling about going there and I would of definitely given 3 star or perhaps 4 star. "
1,"HADEWYCH

We initially had a bad experience on AirBnB and were reluctant to use it but luckily we viewed Hadewych's Houseboat in Amsterdam and she was so helpful and communicative that we regained trust in the service.

She was excellent from initial contact through to arriving in country.  She gave us the confidence and just the right amount of information and support we required.

We did not meet her in person but were well looked after by Ronald on arrival.  Once we settled in we tested (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and he left us to it.  When I dropped him a message he was super fast to reply and a great help.

THE BOAT

The facilities and rooms on the vessel were absolutely perfect. 

* 3 bedrooms; one large double and 2 children's but one would be okay for an adult and there is an additional bed that can be created under the larger of the children's beds.
* Excellent kitchen, with large cooker, dishwasher, washing machine, 2 fridges, toaster, kettle, Nespresso coffee maker and microwave.
* Sitting room with dinning table and bar area; TV with BBC and children's channels.
* 2 bathrooms both with showers (one with a great bath).  Loads of towels.
* On the deck level:
* Room for relaxing or playing games.
* Deck with loads of seating area; great for just watching the boats go past as you drink a glass of wine or watch the sun go down over the relaxed hustle and bustle of Amsterdam city life.

* Loads of cupboard space around the boat.  All European plugs.

We were very comfortable and had everything we needed.

THE LOCATION

Perfectly located for Anne Frank, city shopping or loads of sightseeing.  It is pivotal to get anywhere around Amsterdam without any major effort.

The boat is located by a bridge which has a great diorama of daily life.  Supermarket within 5 minutes walk, ice cream parlour, great shops and restaurants.

The only down sides for some is the sound of the bells every hour and the sound of city life.  If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs.

AMSTERDAM

Just wow.  Love this city so much.  My wife and children did not want to leave.

It has an amazing relaxing quality that just slows you down.  People are carefree and chilled; this is unlike any other major or capital city I have ever been to.  There is just so much to see and do; turn any corner and there is a new sight or experience; it is a city like no other.

Whilst we were there a duck nested and finally laid eggs in one of the plant baskets.  My children named the 2 ducks Ian and Petunia and watched over them constantly.  When we left Petunia was on day 3 of sitting on her eggs and are very keen to know that they hatch and manage to get to the canal waters; Ronald has promised to help them out.

1,"We stayed at Judit's place for Easter and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The apartment, although in need of some upgrade is very cozy and a perfect base for those who travel on a budget. It is in North Amsterdam, which is not the best area of the city, but it takes no more than 20 minutes to get to Central Station by bus. The apartment also comes with free parking which is an absolute plus if you are driving to Amsterdam as the parking is payable 7 days a week virtually everywhere. "
1,The location of the apartment is perfect and the area is lively but not over the top. Everything seemed to be a short tram ride away which was convenient as well as the apartment being immaculate and exactly how it is presented in the pictures. 
1,"Nadia is a wonderful host! She was really friendly and patient - sharing with us directions and recommended places to visit.  

Her place is conveniently located near the Metro station and it takes only about 20mins to reach the central area. The room was comfortable and equipped with all the essentials - Nadia even offered complimentary coffee and tea. 
Would definitely recommend :)"
1,Carolina's apartment is cosy and well located - only 2 minutes by foot to the next bus station which takes one straight to Centraal Station. The bed in the guestroom could be more comfortable but is ok for a few nights. The apartment is clean and the little garden directly in front of the guestroom is lovely on a sunny day. Carolina is very helpful and friendly and guarantees a hassle-free stay.
1,"This apartment is in the perfect area for travelers. Walking distance to all the Amsterdam attractions in the City Center, but also right a 2 minute walk from the Rembrandt Square tram stop if you want to go some of the further sites. 

The apartment itself was spotless when we checked in and had plenty of room to spread out. The kitchen was just the right size to fit some snacks and drinks for the in between moments of our trip and the bathroom had an amazing tub!

We recommend this place to anyone visiting Amsterdam. Thanks for the hospitality Raul!"
1,"Eaay to find and very central 
Parkinglot infront of the door "
0,"This stay was one of my less personal experiences on AirBnB. We met Denise and Dasha, who were lovely and gave us recommendations, but did not mention Paul or Talitha. There was a small misunderstanding over storing our luggage on the last day, we were first told something could be arranged, but at checkout we were pointed towards train station lockers. It is true the place needs a good scrub and some airing, but we found half the windows could not be opened so it was hard to ventilate after the previous occupants (fair enough perhaps, it's advertised as a smoking place). The place was darker than expected. Internet worked great - we were told to use the free public access nearby. We found the second bedroom (too small to store luggage, though the main bedroom has lots of storage space) separated from the corridor by a curtain, which was not clear from the photos, so our privacy-minded friend was a bit disappointed. On the plus side, the flat was comfortable, the kitchen fully equipped and the bathroom was very good indeed. This is a ground floor flat of an authentic canal house in a lively neighbourhood with lots of bars and restaurants, so the location is truly fantastic, perfect for sightseeing. We had an enjoyable trip.

-1,"Hello friends of air bnb,

We had a very bad experience this time, the guy was just watching TV at a clock in the morning and when we started to sleep he didn't stop. The bed smells really not fresh and in the morning we had to learn that the guy was sleeping on the Terrasse, because there was other people that don't know sleeping in the room. Next day we went home and he sleeps in front of the television in the couch. So when you want to do couch surfing for 30€ it's ok."
-1,"Just a bad experience. 
  1) Do not let the neighbors find out you booked via Airbnb.  For it is not allowed. They will report you to apartment super/ management. You will be asked to leave.  
2) in order to use the toilet, you must sit sideways. Very very uncomfortable. 
  3) I inquired upon me leaving the premises where was best to leave the key. I was informed anywhere was fine. 
 I left key inside of the door. So it be easily found by host.  To my surprise I get a notice informing me of a $700.00  bill.  A locksmith had to be called out to open the door.  
  Mind you, no sign specifically stating that if you leave key on door you will be penalized. The problem could have been easily fix by calling the apartment supervisor/management.  In doing so, host would have been discovered as an Airbnb host. Which is a violation of residence rules.  So host opted to call a locksmith and charge me $700.00 dollars to open a door and replicate a key.  Host only had one key.  Again, no specific instructions on where to leave the key after exiting.  
  So avoid this host, avoid this mess. Host is shady.  
  700 dollars I would have stayed at a 5 star hotel.   I do not recommend this place at all.  Absolutely very disappointing and frustrating.  
   Two thumps down.  Just awful experience."
1,"Well located property for the 'local' experience. Huge apartment with plenty of amenities including Nespresso machine, juicer, well stoked pantry and even unexpected welcome wine and local delicies! Maceo is a wonderful host, quick in response and very helpful. He had some great recommendations prepared and was extremely thoughtful! We would definitely recommend Maceo's apartment. Tram stop is outside, metro is less than 5 mins walk and train from airport is very convenient from the property as well. Outside is very lively which may not be suitable for light sleepers (our friends that live in the area had prewarned us, it was no issues for the 2 of us) cosmopolitan and main tourist attractions are within walking distance. Note like most apartments in Amsterdam there are steep stair Maceo however assisted with helping us with our luggage upon his friendly welcome. Maceo was also very flexible with check out times which was extremely appreciated. We have no hesitation in recommending Maceo's place. Thanks again!"
-1,"Dwayne sent me 1 message in the month before I was supposed to stay with him. When I arrived he was not there and I had to find a new place to stay. He was awful and wasted half of my day, I want my money back."
1,"What a fabulous boat. It's a converted barge, so spacious and roomy. One main bedroom with a large double bed and sink. Beautifully decorated. The second cabin bed is a single. But there is also a comfy sofa bed in the living room that is a very large double. So plenty of space. It has a pretty well appointed kitchen so you can cook rather tha  eat out if you want to. The location is excellent. Tucked away towards the end of a canal so it's nice and quiet, but also just about a 20 mins walk to the museums through the park, and with restaurants and cafes just round the corner. It's a tranquil place to come back to after a hard day of touristing! My only mark down was for value, but that has more to do with the awful post brexit exchange rate. In summary, it's a unique and lovely base to have to explore a brilliant city."
1,Judit's place was perfect for privacy and resting. It has everything you need. She was accommodating with our checking in time. 
1,Great host
1,"Luciano's house is very well located. You'll find 2 buses (34 and 35) that will take you from Central Station to his house in about 10min and they go by every 4-9min depending on the hour. The maximum we had to wait was 8min really early in the morning, all the other times was 4min or less, even after 11pm. From the bus stop is only 1min walking to his house, so it's really great. The house is very comfortable, the kitchen is big and there are 2 bathrooms. We couldn't find a toaster but there are plenty of pans, frying pans and utensils. There's a kettle too and space in the fridge was available for the cheese and other stuff we bought. On that note: OMG you need to try the Old Amsterdam cheese!!! SO GOOD!!! The whole house has carpeted floors, except for the kitchen. If you're prone to allergies, this might not be the place for you. In my case it really hit me the first day (my nose deals awfully with carpets!), but by the second day I had adjusted and had no more allergies. There's also visible cobwebs in the walls, which could trigger allergies as well, so be mindful of that. The house in general was always clean, though removing the cobwebs would be a good idea. The bathroom was clean and comfortable (with 1 exception I'll mention in the next paragraph), with lots of toilet paper available. There were no towels and we were only handed 2: 1 big and 1 small (it was me and my husband). The towels wasn't a problem for us since we travel with towels, but this might be something to consider if you don't usually do so. The only thing that bothered me in the bathroom was the shower: there's no step or door dividing the area from the rest of the room, only a curtain. This means you have to be really careful if you don't want the water spilling all over. The floor sinks in that area so the water flows that way, but it's still messy. The bedroom was spacious, with lots of places to hang or put your stuff, lots of cabinets too. The bed was really comfortable, it's not an inflatable mattress but a folding couch instead, one of those IKEA couches that are really sturdy and comfortable. We slept well. There's a church near so during the night you hear bells ringing, the first time it surprised us, but it didn't disturb our sleeping. You might want to pack an eye mask because the stairs light is always on and it gets into the room. You can lock the room and there's a lot of privacy. We only crossed paths with Luciano twice, both times he was very nice and brief, keeping to himself. Xuhui welcomed us and gave us the tour and the keys, he was also very nice and funny. Overall a pleasant stay except for the shower issue,..."
1,"We really liked the are Imani was living. Our room was nice and clean and having your own entrance is awesome. The Busstation and the shops are just in front of her house. 
The only negative thing is that Imani should mention in her description that she has two little kids. They were loud and waked us up several times during the morning.

1,"This was my first trip to Amsterdam and not my last. This place was fabulous and so close to everything. Fast replies, beautiful home and excellent referrals to places we needed.  I will book this place again.  Thanks for everything Raul."
-1,"Bad experience. Very dirty. The host is not responsive. The cleaning was done only at 19 pm (Alex changed only the sheet of our bed, that’s all.)The kitchen was disgusting. The dishes were dirty, we had no cutlery (no clean fork and no knife ), no clean plates. The WC was also dirty; there were drops of pee on the bowl. And there were only two toilet paper roll and no soap. I do not advise this Airbnb."
-1,"Overall bad experience. The place feels like you invade someone's home. The apartment has no airconditioning, which was pretty hard to handle. The kitchen was the main problem, the fridge was full and smelled, and the plates and glasses had spiderwebs in them."
0,"Far outside the City Center of Amsterdam, but near the final Metro Station of M54 which Goes straight to Amsterdam Centraal in 25 Minutes. good communication with the Host. the nice cat is very familiar and Seeks contact( so allergics should Watch Out). Only one bathroom for Up to 4 guests and the Two Hosts, can be critical. okay for one or Two days"
1,"This beautiful home has everything an impersonal hotel does not! It is a quiet, soft oasis just a short ride away from the busy city center. The house is clean, modern, filled with light, and art, and situated on a waterway with spectacular views from every single window. It was so lovely to sink into the most comfortable bed after a long day, and then leisurely awake to the sight of geese and other water birds, and horses in the distant meadows.  The huge corner bathroom is indescribably awesome with a slate rainfall shower, gigantic tub and incredible views. 
Avishai and Katjalisa are wonderful hosts. They made sure I had everything I needed including a great bike. I even got to hear Avishai play piano.   A treat in itself! 
I would love to return on my next trip to Amsterdam. It was a truly unique and memorable experience! 
"
-1,"The ""host"" is really a company: their employers are very polite but the organization (or lack of) is a mess. They arrived late to let us in, I asked for a cot and they brought a broken one and there were no lights in the apartment; they sent someone to fix it and then the electricity installation was busted, so we had to leave the apartment for about two hours until they fixed the problem. The apartment is very nice but we were wrongly blamed of breaking a tiny piece of a lamp that apparently costed 400 Euros (!!!!). I never had any bad experiences with Airbnb until this one, which is a shame because the location in relly unique."
1,Nadia very informational and guided me to her apartment with extensive directions. She was very kind and took me around the neighborhood while I was waiting for a friend. The room is very cozy and has all the essential things needed. I would highly recommend Nadia's room for anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam and would like a nice quiet area to come home to. 
1,"Great place, excellent location"
0,"Andy is a wonderful host and was extremely helpful and informative with us at check-in and during our stay. He pointed out a number of restaurants, sights and shops to us and seemed to really love his city, his home and hosting guests from around the world.   He couldn't have been nicer! However, keep in mind that you will not get an ""entire house/apt"".  You will get two small rooms with a shared bath at the top of two flights of incredibly steep and narrow stairs.  I do not recommend this house for anyone with small children or those who would have trouble navigating the two sets of stairs.  Also, while the bathroom was generally acceptable, the sink comes with two separate faucets: one for scalding hot water and one for freezing water.  These two faucets do not bring the water together which makes washing one's face, hands or shaving almost impossible. The shower is typically European, an open tub with no curtain or enclosure. The two rooms were comfortable as were the beds.  The bedroom at the front, with the double bed, is a bit larger than the one at the back, with two single beds.  The only place to relax is on the beds, as the small table and chairs in the front bedroom are really not best for this. "
1,Ronald was a very nice host. His apartment is great!! It's well situated just near the centre of Amsterdam. Everything was clean and very comfortable. Ronald cared about everything fast and reliable. Thank you for hosting us in such a friendly way! :)
-1,"We did like almost nothing in this room. Room was smelling badly, toilet is too small for a human being. Also couch was extremely bad, my back still hurts. I didnt feel hygenic in this room and it was a bad experience for us. "
-1,"The apartment that me and my friends saw has nothing to do with the one at the photos . It was so dirty and it smelled so awful you could not take a breath !! I have taken so many photos of the real apartment you may not believe in your eyes ! I wonder what kind of person want to deceive tourists and ruin the image of the city sometimes ! 
Of course the hostess after our complaints never showed up in messages or phone calls and everything found their right way with Airbnb . 
It is so sad that we should stay somewhere else the last minute!! Our suffering was due to the fact that hostess was not willing to clean the apartment as she claimed that it was clean and she shut down the phone telling me that we have just different aspect of cleanliness. 
I have a lot of photos showing the mess and the deceit .
Apartment lack of soap as well . 
In conclusion hostess informed after 24 hours Airbnb that the apartment was ready ( Saturday evening ) but it was really late for us as we needed safe and clean roof over our head as well a clean place for our staff ."
-1,"DON'T GO THERE :
Lita is not the one you will see but a other person apparently call Dave. I can't be sure cause he hasn't any air b and b profil and use Lita's one. He pretends Lita is his wife .  You have to trust him about that.  I booked for 3 nights but only spent 2 nights at his place. The second morning , Dave kicks me out from ""his"" flat. He never had the permission to host air B and B traveller fom the co-owners of the bulding. So in 5 min, the 2nd morning , he just tell me I had to leave right now the room, no time to take my breakfast or to plan anything else. I travelled all around the world, i had hundred of different accomodations but this experience was the worst so far. Dave was so stressfull , he thought I would like to ripped him off cause I just wanted to know how much money he has to give me back for the night I didn't spend. I had to drive him to the ATM to get my money back. 
The worst is that he asks me to not leave any bad comments on Lita's profil to keep a good reputation on the website. It's to easy to ask that to people , they just want to make money nothing else. Now I'm wondering how many bad experiences hasn't been report to this profil. Maybe no one or maybe a lot, you can not trust someone who ask you to not leave bad comments on their profil. 
I don't care to get a bad comment on my profil air b and b after telling the story because it will help people who when to spend some good time in Amsterdam to avoid falling into the trap of this Air B and B accomodation. "
1,"Carolina was an amazing host! She's incredibly friendly and easy to get along with. She's more than willing to give advice on cool places to go and things to do/see, and fun to talk with! Her place is great! Very clean, very cute, and very welcoming. Her garden is a great place to hang out. I would wholeheartedly recommend staying with Carolina. "
-1,"It's quite unpleasant to write bad reviews on Airbnb, but I almost feel as I'm obliged to in this situation.

The main issue we had is the awful check in experience. Though there were other issues as well. 

Carlos literally made us check in at 6 pm, which is obviously too late. He insisted we would be checking in at the exact time (6pm +- 15 minutes) because of his busy schedule. While it was very inconvenient, I thought it would be still acceptable for us, and  didn't deserve escalation to Airbnb support (the type of thinking which I regret now). 

Now, even after making us check in late, Carlos was late for more than an hour (with his phone periodically being switched off and directing to voicemail). As a result, we had wasted more than 1 hour from our 2 days in Amsterdam just waiting for him.

For the apartment itself, as already mentioned in other reviews, it's rather dirty. The dust under the bed and in other places likewise seems to be never cleaned.

There was a drop of soap, almost no shampoo or shower gel. Luckily we had some essentials from previous hotels where we stayed.
There were only 2 towels for 2 people, and one of the towels was very small.

The TV was not attached and therefore not working.

I would recommend to avoid this listing if you have other options. But if you need to stay there for any reason, make sure to talk about check in in your reservation before you pay, and also bring your own shampoo, shower gel and towels."
-1,"Although Ruslan was very nice and helpful we had a bad experience. We stayed at his place twice in a period of around 10 days, as Amsterdam was the central point for our trip. First time we found some bed bugs in our bedroom. As we had had already sorted the second stay and for giving a second try, we got back to his place at the end of our trip. This time, it was cold and we wouldn't have hot water. So it was kind of frustrating for us."
1,"Andrea is a good host, nice and considerate, makes you feel comfortable . Plus, her place is very beautiful and the neighborhood is peaceful. I enjoyed the good time ."
1,"Frank is a wonderful host! Quick and friendly communication, great local tips and very informative about the city. The room is older but very neat. It is private with your own entrance, bathroom and balcony - a perfect quiet space after the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. "
-1,"Unfortunately, we have had bad experiences with Lerna. You do not live with someone, but in a private apartment. No real air bnb. The contact is very impersonal! Pity! The kitchen is incomplete. Holidays like in IKEA's exhibition. If you can not find anything else in Amsterdam you can stay here as well."
0,"Mirjam is a lovely host, I had a nice stay in her apartment. I particularly liked the cute little balcony that gives you a nice view of the trees and the bed was nice and comfortable. The apartment is located very close to a bus stop but I wouldn't suggest it for a solo traveller who plans to have a few late nights out like myself  because it takes about 30-40 minutes by bus to get to any of the popular tourist attractions and the buses don't run after midnight so I found myself spending A LOT of euros on taxis home. The wifi isn't always the best as well, cutting out occasionally. Otherwise, I had a lovely stay :) "
-1,"The end of our journey to Europe was almost ruined by the host of this scam. Just this listing demostrates well how Airbnb can be exploited. My comment will be lost among hundreds of ""good stay, great host"", but my short review would be: No privacy, loud rude host, uncomfortable tiny room. The host will torture you with a complicated lecture of how to do what and how not to. Be careful, since there are two rooms in the apartment and the host lives in a room without a door.  Despite this, every evening the host was Speaking on the phone loudly.
After many years of travelling, that was the Worst place I've stayed so far on Airbnb, absolutely not worth the money spent... The host has two rooms, but he still give you a tiny room as a private room. Horrible experience. Careful, friends."
1,"Kees apartment is very cosy, conveniently located and overall a perfect spot for a trip to Amsterdam. The apartment is a 10-15 min walk to just about all the main attractions. Kees was very polite and helpful, and we would be glad to stay at his apartment again."
-1,"Simon was very irresponsible for the duration of our stay. We did not have internet for the duration of 5 days. We messaged Simon letting him know the internet did not work and he blatantly ignored this and now is ignoring discussions about a refund. Very inconvenient and impossible to plan around.
Upon arrival everything was dirty. Stained sheets, food wrappers on tables, and towels wet. The cleaning staff arrives an hour later and claims they need an hour to clean and we awkwardly left the apartment which was terrible as we were in the middle of a nap. We assumed that the apartment would be clean when we arrived and this bothered us.

The actions of the host made this stay a bad experience and I do not recommend this Airbnb to anyone because if a slight issue occurs you will not receive help."
-1,"The apartment was not fully equipped. Most of the things in the pictures and the list are nowhere to find. For example, there is no iron, dryer and the 3 single beds did not even have sheets on the mattress. We checked the whole place but we couldn't find any. One of the beds was also broken. 

The apartment was not very clean. Also the bathroom door makes things very uncomfortable cause it's glass and its faced to the kitchen table.

The location is very near to the Metro station that goes to the center but the area is not really safe.

For the check-in we had to wait outside in the cold for almost 30 minutes. 

We would not recommend this apartment for your stay in Amsterdam. "
1,"Thank you so much Carolina for our wonderful stay! The apartment is really homey and beautiful, and Carolina was so friendly and helpful with letting us know how best to get from place to place. So easily accessible by bus to the city center, and in a beautiful, quiet green neighborhood; we had an amazing time. I would recommend everyone going to Amsterdam stay with Carolina!"
1,"I recommand you this place to you all :) There is everything in the kitchen to cook if you want. The place is really cosy and as a couple we really enjoy it. There are a lot of cool restaurants and bar around, and Amsterdam is really near with the tram or bus (bus and tram stop are just 5 min by foot). "
-1,"We stayed here for 2 nights and unexpectedly it was really a bad experience. The room really small (about 10m2), located below street level, wi-fi is not working. The location is good but not enough to assert the price of a hotel of medium-high level. Hosts non-existent, especially at the time of check-out, completely disinterested. Not recommended.

1,"Cute neighborhood that is out if the touristy/crowded areas, but close enough that we did all of our exploring on foot. Cozy, clean room, with nice big windows that get beautiful morning light! Most importantly Debra and Benjamin are relaxed, wonderful humans, who will make your stay spectacular."
-1,Absolute awful apartment and stay. Place advertised couldn't be further from what you are greeted with. no TV fireplace or feature wall. dirty beds. the list goes on it is awful
1,"Great location, central to many areas you will want to travel to. Everything you need is within walking distance."
1,"I enjoyed my stay with Anna and her gorgeous cat.  Anna is a good host and very friendly.  Her home is comfortable with excellent amenities.
Location has good transport with the Metro station conveniently close by to get back into Central Amsterdam."
0,"Great location!!! The apartment itself was very nice. Only negative is that the bedroom is very small.. Just enough room to walk down one side. Also, was quite disappointed to find what appeared to be dirty linen on the bed. Fortunately I located some fresh sheets and made up the bed myself. Just a shame when the cleaning fee was pretty high in comparison to many of the other properties listed. I would stress however that everything else was great and that Stephanie was really helpful getting another set of keys cut for us when we wanted to leave our bags in the hall after check out. The location really cannot be beaten. Amsterdam is sub a beautiful city and everything was within walkable distance."
1,"Our stay at the studio in Amsterdam was lovely. A perfect location, we easily walked everywhere but there is also tram stop nearby if needed. The studio is a great size and contains everything you need. Kitchen, bathroom and large bed. The hosts were super easy to contact and made it very simple to find the apartment. Overall a great experience and would stay again! Thank you Annelies :)"
-1,"Good

Great looking place, Weird but great. Decent facilities. Its quite far from town but not too bad. Relaxed and friendly owners. Priced well

Bad

Some of the beds were not clean or changed after previous guests. One bed had a full bin in it! another smelt really awful and had cigarette butts in it. Wifi was poor

If the beds were good this place would get 4, maybe 5 stars but the bed issue was really bad."
0,"Nice place. House is cosy and good for groups. Great living room/kitchen and really great place for evening after a night in Amsterdam. Much better to party in the centre and come back to a place like this rather than staying in the centre.
Would not recommend for more than 6 people as one bathroom and more will need to stay in living room. A bit difficult to find so have (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps ready.
Getting to town can be difficult but not a problem if you're not intending to go back and forth. Bus is good but maybe 20 mins. Taxi is quick but around 20-25 eur. Ferry unfortunately is difficult to get to but is a nice experience if you're not in a hurry.
Make sure you ask how the heating works as it switches off automatically sometimes.
Kitchen has everything you need. Lots of blankets, towels etc.
Overall a pleasant experience but not for everyone. If you're there to go clubbing till 6am or you need a kebab shop under your house - this is not the place to go."
1,"We had a great stay at this awesome apartment. It was bright, nice view of the river, very clean, great location, couldn't ask for much more really. Vera was terrific.
I certainly don't recommend hiring a bike from the bike shop on the corner....they were awful. Try Work cycles instead, they were great.

Would definitely stay here again if we're lucky enough to be in Amsterdam in the future.

-1,"I tryed to check in for two hours after the host told me I could check in at 3:00. I have texted the host four times with no response. The previous week Maarten told me that I might be able to check in early when we arrived from our overnight flight if he didnt have any guests. When we arrived at 11 am I texted to see if we could check in early. He said no that he had to clean up after the previous guests. At that point He suddenly told me to pick up keys at Easy Drop which is 25 minutes away by car. He never told me that I would have to go to another location to pick up the keys so I was confused. I texted him four times asking for clarification and never received a response. I am disabled and unable to walk very well and wasnt sure where to go. I didnt want to take an Uber across town if I was going to the wrong place. I communicated seversl times that day trying to check in to the apartment as early as possible because I had been on an over night flight and was exhausted. Finally, I took an uber to the apartment at 3:00, the time he told me to check in and nobody was there to let us in the apartment. I texted several times and suddenly the host no longer responded to my inquiries. It felt like it was a scam as there were no signs on the door and three apartment numbers at 209 not just one. None of them had Maarten’s name on the mailbox. That is when I realized this might be a scam so I looked again at his reviews to see if maybe just his friends had posted reviews. Unfortunatly, I noticed that there was now a negative review from feb that had not been posted when I booked and it revealed that Maarten was having problems with his managrment company and the apartment was filthy. After four unanswered emails (in which I asked him to clarify where the key was) I called the number on the reservation and I got IamB&B.com and they said that they are no longer the hosting company. The plot thickens and what I thought was a legitimate rental is now a scam but it gets worse. They gave me a different number for a new company that they said was managing the property and when I called that number nobody answered the phone. It was disconnected. At that point I had been standing in 0 celsius weather for 30 minutes with my suitcases, a guest, and no place to stay. I tried for two hours to get a hold of someone to get in. By then it was almost five oclock so I had to book another hotel for the night because it was a busy friday night and I was afraid that all of the hotels would..."
0,"I struggle with how to review this place because the apartment itself is great but the experience left a lot to be desired.

Firstly, this flat is not being listed by its owner but rather a local rental broker that rents a large number of homes. This was the downside of staying in this flat. I have no idea who Wouter is as I never met him and I’m pretty sure he never messaged me. I was messaged by a rotation of young employees who never identified themselves by name in their messages, a fact I only realized upon trying to pick up keys from a young man whose face and name I had never seen before. The company insisted I use a separate website to coordinate a lot of details about my stay, almost making renting through Airbnb useless. I wouldn’t have had a major problem with any of that, if this company also hadn’t: (1) given me incorrect information (wifi info was wrong, whoever messaged me couldn’t figure it out, we had to rummage through the owner’s papers to find it); (2) given the owner incorrect information, resulting in her trying to enter the apartment in the early hours of our last day there; (3) failed to provide the promised apartment manual (useful for operating appliances in other languages); and (4) communicated poorly about when we could expect a delivery of extra towels (we were woken up again by a new person who never identified himself by name) and flat out ignored my last message about the owner trying to enter the flat. The first two are the major issues; the second two exacerbated the bad experience. I use Airbnb because I expect the prompt and helpful replies of homeowner hosts. I did not receive that personal, knowledgeable host experience.

That said, Tjarda’s flat (because she is the owner) is a wonderful place. There was a persistent leak on the floor in the water closet and the shower curtain was moldy on the bottom, but if the above problems hadn’t occurred I wouldn’t care much. The apartment was overall very clean, stylish, comfortable, well appointed, and larger than the photos show. (The couch is missing a section shown in the photos.) The bed was comfortable albeit with the seemingly obligatory flat European pillows. There is lots of storage space so you don’t have to live out of your suitcase. I loved having a large living room with big windows. I cooked in the kitchen and enjoyed all the amenities. The shower had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The apartment is about a 25-30 mins walk to city center but it’s an easy walk since Amsterdam is very flat, plus it’s beautiful by the canals. We took an Uber to Centraal Station. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and residential, providing a true feel for “life as a local.” (Beware, all the shops close very early so buy your groceries during the day!)

A long review, yes, but I wanted to convey our mixed experience with this flat. Host: 3/5; flat: 5/5."
1,"Femke was a great host!  Her response time is usually within the hour, almost always in half a day, and never later than a day.  Before the stay, Femke answered all questions super quick, and very honestly.  When we reached Amsterdam, we had had a series of bad experiences with the flights: a delay of 7 hours on the Mumbai-Dubai flight; a missed Dubai-Amsterdam connection; a re-booking; and a misplaced bag.  We messaged Femke that we would be arriving around 5 hours late.  She responded in a very comforting way.  We called her as soon as we landed in Amsterdam, and she was very welcoming.  

Femke offered to stay back the next day to be there when the airline delivered the  bag, which she not only did, but messaged us immediately.  

Femke offered suggestions for our dinner restaurant, and enquired how it was!  All in all a great host.

The place is very adequate, but a wee bit inconvenient for older persons like us.  The location is a bit out of the way, but exactly as described in the website.  You can't step out into the centre of Amsterdam -- you need to walk to the buss stop and take a bus; again, Femke was very, very open and transparent about it.  The living space is very adequate - and great for younger persons.  For us, it was the experience which we enjoyed.

On the positives: very quiet place; clean; on the canal.  You will sleep like a baby without any disturbance.

The downside (not at all Femke's doing): it was the Pentecost weekend, and many places were closed!  We stayed back on Day 3 to visit the Albert Cuypmarket and the Musuems -- only to find out after a lot of time that both were closed.

We left on Day 3"
1,"Mirjam's place is just heavenly. Open and lots of space (especially for Amsterdam!), with green views through every window. Minutes away from the centre, but feels miles away so truly the best of both worlds. I'd stay again in a heartbeat : )"
0,"When I first saw the listing of this apartment on the Airbnb app, I thought it was beautiful! Looked super clean and had a bunch of nice features. This was my first trip to Europe, so I was very excited! When I arrived, the place was very clean, bathroom was nice, the living room looked modern - very nice, cute place! Taraq was very kind to greet us and asked if we had any questions about anything. As some hours went by, we ran into some issues:
- Fridge broken: We could not properly refrigerate our groceries because it was not working. We had to throw away most of the food we bought. (FYI: Both fridge and freezer were not working).
- No lights in the kitchen nor the living room (e.g. eating in the dark at the kitchen, making sure to light candles in the living room, etc.)
- No hot water: Our visit consisted of cold showers. It was tolerable the first day, but every day after that was awful. 
- No WiFi: the WiFi worked for the first thirty minutes of our stay. After that, it never appeared on our WiFi settings again. We could not watch any movies, listen to music, nor contact anyone from our phones. In addition, there was no projector in the living room, like the listing presented on the Airbnb site. I was really looking forward to that; a warning could have been nice. 
- Stove: I was really looking forward to cooking, but the stove wasn’t working. It’s a gas stove (something I’m unfamiliar with), but I YouTubed directions and tried dozens of times, but could not get it to work. This was either me not knowing how to use it or the stove really wasn’t working.

I tried contacting Taraq about some of these issues and he responded to each and every one. However, none of his responses were helpful nor an attempt to fix the issues we were having. Overall, the apartment was clean and that’s very important! The bed was also very comfortable. My boyfriend and I made the best of our trip and didn’t let the Airbnb issues ruin our stay. Thanks, Taraq for letting us stay in your home!"
1,Perfect location and only take 15 minutes train to airport. The host is very nice and we have a good stay in Amsterdam.
-1,"Pam rents an old tiny dirty apartment far from the city center.
It was very disturbing to see the dark stains, mold/mildew on her bed/mattress and pillows prior to laying down to go to sleep.
I took photos of them to show to airbnb as it is not healthy for anyone to sleep on a mattress that has gotten wet and is OLD,  Dirty and NASTY with dark stains ALL over it. I do not know how stains like this get all over a mattress other than from many years of Sweat or URIINE or dampness/mold Growth but NO ONE should have to be subjected to this unhealthy sleeping condition.
Airbnb needs to assure their customers that if a bed or pillow has stains on it that the customer is allowed to leave and get a refund. Also, her upstair neighbor was very loud stomping above the room along with noisy cars on the road outside. I had NO sleep as I was laying on hard sofa with no pillow to use as hers were stained and awful.
Her bedroom is so tiny it only fits a small mattress and nothing else in the room. 
I will NOT be using airbnb anymore as this is the third rental out of 21 rentals that I had stains on beds and pillows and or negative experiences. I have loved airbnb up till the last few rentals and I was paying 93 to 120 per night in these rental with stains and noise and filth so it was not because I was paying a low price. Now I have a bad review because I reacted to the distgusting mattress and pillows etc. in her apartment. 
I had 12 GREAT reviews prior to this one and this is NOT fair to me since I only reacted to a very negative unhealthy situation. "
1,"We had a bad experience at a hotel the night before, Thankfully Sarah had allowed us to check in at 9am :) The apartment was lovely, as you see if the photos, great location with coffee shops, Food Market and Tram stop outside for 17, or 7.

The apartment was not noisy at all and the bedroom is at the back of the building with a lovely balcony which was lovely to sit after a long day with walking, we often sat there with Fruit and cheese and of course a smoke.

I can not say how much of a lovely experience and how accommodating Sarah has been , this is a real gem of a place and the location is not right in the centre, but not far at all and also not far from Anne Franks house.

Thanks you for an amazing place...."
1,everything perfect!! Julie was very nice!! 
-1,"I definitely od not recommend this place to anyone. 
I was fooled by the mixed reviews about it and went on with my reservation. I wished the reviews had warned me about the awful uncleanliness of the place, which was really unacceptable and made any sum of money too much to pay to stay in a place like this. 
The host was shady - he kept calling me chiquitita which really upset me and made feel unsafe - and the address is not the one described in the airbnb account. There was hash and weed on the kitchen table and the second room in the house is shared with other airbnb guests.
I could hear rats walking on the ceiling above my head and the floor was stained with indescribable stuff, plus of course there were hairs in the already very dirty bathroom and inside the bed, which was made with creasy bed sheets that you couldn't understand wether they had been washed or not. 
After two hours in there I canceled my reservation and had to leave."
1,I could not recommend this place enough!  Feliciano was right there at the front desk and knew who we were and made us feel right at home. Everyone was very nice and I felt very safe there.  Room was in great shape. Thanks so much and I hope to come back again!
1,"Andrea when above and beyond the call of duty.  Staying at Andrea's was like staying at a fancy hotel!  Everything is exactly like it's shown the picture.  It took us about 30 minutes to get from her place to Amsterdam Central, but it was well worth the trip.   A perfect oasis to come to after a long day of walking and sightseeing!  Andrea has thought of everything: from providing you with a snack on your first day after a long journey to the nice comfy bathrobes waiting along the walls.  The way Andrea's place is set up offers you the perfect amount of privacy, as your room and hers are completely separated.  We had to share the  bathroom, but we never had any issues, and there was hardly ever a time when we had to wait for the bathroom.

Things to keep in mind: the walls to the exterior are very thin, so noise from the outside travels very well.  This may be a problem if you are a light sleeper.  However, you can probably fix this with ear plugs.  Also, there is no access to the kitchen, but you can just talk to Andrea and she will probably be able to provide you with any essential kitchen tools that you need.  Again, these are minor things, and I wouldn't think of them as issues, but more like things to keep in mind.  Juha and I weren't bothered at all by these things.

Overall, an excellent place to stay.  I've used Airbnb for several of my vacations, and I don't think I've met anyone who has put so much thought into her Airbnb rental.  You can't go wrong with this place.  If you want to enjoy luxury at an affordable price, this is the way to go!"
1,"Me and my boyfriend stayed for 3 nights, we had a great time. Appartment was perfect for a long weekend break, we loved the big balcony! and the bus stop is almost right outside the appartment and it takes only 15 minutes to get to central Amsterdam with buses running very frequently. There is a small convenience store a minute away and a huge shopping complex 10 minutes walk away. Judit was a friendly and helpful host, We had everything we needed for our stay and would definitely recommend this appartment for a well priced city break. "
1,"The Niels house is the better place you can stay in Amsterdam. The house is much better than in the photos, amazing, stilish, big, with a lot of light. The terrace is the perfect place to relax after a busy day in Amsterdam, having a drink or even having a bath ig the weather is sunny!! 
Although we couldn’t meet Niels personally, the checkin was fantastic with Grace...they had some delicious details and wine prepared for us when we arrived. You will have lots of recommendations and tips written in order to make your stay as nice as possible...
To sum up, I think there is one of the better houses to stay in Amsterdam, if you choose it you will enjoy for sure!!"
1,"I was planning on traveling to Amsterdam by myself for a weekend, and chose to stay in a shared apartment due to budget. However, like many others have said, staying with Sharon is really like staying with a friend, and even if I had a larger budget I would happily stay here again!

Sharon was very helpful with directions and was flexible with my late check-in time. She gave lots of tips for the city and was even kind enough to help me figure out public transport. But beyond that she is really fun and easy to talk to, right off the bat. Even though I was exhausted when I arrived, I quickly forgot about that and happily chatted with her for 30 minutes. Plus her cat is a riot! That being said, if you prefer not to socialize much with the host, Sharon will definitely respect your wishes. It's clear she does her best to be a great host for all types of guests.

As for the room, it is cozy and small, but it has everything you need. Some shelves are provided, a place to hang clothes, a comfy bed, linen and towels, plus bonus stroopwafels! She also provides a large bottle of water and a drinking glass, which not many Airbnb hosts do, so that was a nice touch. I think it is best suited for a shorter trip or for people who travel relatively light. Personally I found the room to be a good size for one person - for the solo traveler this place is ideal. 

The entire apartment is very clean. The bathroom was spotless - probably cleaner than my own, to be honest - and I had no problem sharing. The shower was very nice and got nice and hot as well! I didn't use the kitchen much, but that too was very clean. Sharon also has an amazing kettle if you are inclined to make a cup of tea. 

The weather was pretty awful during my trip so I didn't get to use the garden, but it looked lovely and would be great in warmer weather. The house also has a nice heating system so despite the cold weather I never felt cold. I would just caution those with allergies, as there is a cat and it is a smoking household (but no smoking in the room), so it may not be ideal for those with very sensitive noses.

Overall 10/10, would gladly stay here again!!"
1,"The best place to stay! After a bad experience in airbnb the Fon's house was like a miracle! Clean, big, with all the comforts, big balkony, logical price  and easy transportation in Amsterdam! The metro was 2 minutes walking and the bus station outside of the house so I wasn't afraid to return alone with the night bus! Fon's hospitality was perfect! She gave us all the instructions that we needed and in addition the last day she print for us our tickets! she was really helpful and kind and I definitely suggest it for you stay!"
1,Everything from initial description to meeting us on arrival and then being available to answer our questions was spot on. I would recommend anyone trying the experience of living on the water and Erik and Margriet's boat is a fantastic example. You will not be disappointed !
-1,"this was the first time I have had a bad experience with the place we stayed. It was not as discribed, it had no heating as we were told, the linens were not clean, there was mice or rats, the pictures failed to mention the huge hole in the boat. We were so upset we had to leave and find another place. Which cost us much more money on last notice. We never met Aryeh and couldn't get ahold of him the whole time after he told us where the key would be. Every time we called his number it said it had been disconnected. Our experience was an awful one and I would not recommend staying here. It was not even the slightest bit comfortable. "
1,"Astrid was a great host! The place was even better than we had expected and felt at home when staying with her, couldn't be happier."
1,"Lovely apartment, perfect for 2 couples... Never used air bnb before and I have heard a lot of bad experiences but Veronica is very helpful and insists on contacting her if you need anything. Stairs are very steep so I wouldn't recommend to elderly or anyone with young children. Great location! Only about 5 min walk from train station and less than 10 mins to central city. But would definitely stay here again."
1,"Very easy to find the chap from KeyOkay. Place was clean and stocked with water and delicious stroopwaffles! 

Roof terrace is amazing in the sun.

Can't recommend this place enough - I will be back, although I won't recommend doing a leg workout the day before... The stairs in Holland are unique."
-1,"Flat ok but awful bathroom because the shower is in a closet. I had to shave in the kitchen!!!
The cleaning wasn't perfect"
-1,"If you want a place really clean to stay, this is not your place. We had a very bad experience. The floors, the shower, the kitchen were really dirty, even sticky. It was dusty. We informed the host about it, but he didn't do anything about. We had to clean the shower to take one. I hardly not recommend this place."
0,"Nathaly and her husband were very welcoming, the apartment is big and bright. You have pretty much all you need, but we missed 2 pillows for the couch (we were 4 guests) and enough towels. You should mention from the beginning if you need towels.
The livingroom with the sleeping couch has no blinds, so if you are a light sleeper, you should be aware.

The biggest disappointment was the cleanliness in general, especially in the kitchen. The cleaning fee is in this case not justified!
Neighbourhood and environment very pleasant and safe.
"
0,"Daniel and Thera’s apartment is in a great area of Amsterdam, the 4 tram is less than a five minute walk away and it heads northbound straight up into the heart of the city. Plus, there is a supermarket around the corner, very convenient!

The flat is clean and comfortable, with some unique design features making it one of the more unusual AirBnB’s I’ve stayed at! There is a fridge, Nespresso coffee machine and kettle in the living room. With so many good cafes and restaurants close by, there’s no need for anything more. The welcome was friendly, Daniel was there as we arrived, communications were good prior to our stay. He said to I should call/text with any queries and he'd be happy to help throughout our stay. All good stuff! A VERY comfy bed and free wifi is always a bonus too!

The only real downside to our stay was the noise. Having arrived from a very long journey we needed to nap but couldn't because of a god awful racket from upstairs. It sounded like a young child stamping a hard as they could on the floor for around an hour, until he moved downstairs into the shared hall, which is
separated from the bedroom by a plasterboard wall. 
Very difficult to ignore!
This continued each morning from 7:45 until (I presume) they left to take the child to school.

The owners live in the flat above and it feels like you're not renting your own private space as the hall where they do their washing, and which is their access to their work studio is the same hall we used to get to our toilet/shower room which
was itself only walled 2/3 of the way up to the ceiling, meaning ablutions were less than private.

Another small privacy issue: there is translucent pink glass
between the hall and the flats living room. Meaning that anyone in the hall has
a clear view of your living space. 
Otherwise, the design details are exactly
as advertised, it is a beautifully quirky space filled with unusual pieces, and
the photos are accurate. Thanks for a comfortable stay! 


"
1,"Really enjoyed our stay. It was a very different place to stay, beautifully done up and Erik and Margriet were fabulous hosts. The weather was awful so we never ventured far at night despite planning otherwise but we found a couple of great places to eat and drink nearby. Definitely recommended."
0,"Great location. Big room. Would say to be flexible with checkin time - host was not there for about 3 hours after the noted checkin time. Not quite as pictured. The room itself is, but the living area is where she slept so I wouldn’t say that it’s a shared area. Had some trouble getting in with the key because if there’s a key in the door from the inside you can’t get in. Not a bad experience but not the greatest either. "
-1,"Quite possibly the worst experience. There was no front door. There is a door into the building but then our unit that was advertised as “two bedroom” was a basement that anyone can gain entrance into. As soon as we walked in we asked for a spare key to enter the building as it was 4 of us we were told that the host would be back in an hour. We were called an hour latter and told it will be 20€ for the extra key. There was no heat for 5 days. We asked every day. We also asked for extra blankets because we were cold. We were told it would be 20€ for extra blankets. We continued to ask for extra heat every day. No one responded. One person left and went to a hotel after the first night. 3 of us slept at a friend’s house our last night there. So no heat, no front door, one room is a closet w a bed in it without a door on it, no one to talk to. The Canadian guy that came to let us in was nice. Let him run this poorly mismanaged company.  Pauline is not a real person. At no point did we get a proper human response other then the nice gent that greeted us on our first day and promised to come back in an hour.The phone line says “please wait and someone will assist you” I waited a lot. In Holland it’s roaming for us from the USA. So all in all 1200$ for a very bad experience. If I could’ve gone to a hotel and bought a 2000$ flight back home like my friend who went home did I would’ve. I instead staid and ended up in the emergency room that cost me additional 250€ because of a fever chill. I was consistently cold. This is my first bad review. I’ve never had anything close to this experience. Probably will refrain from using AirBNB in the future because I was told that they couldn’t send an outline of where it says that a “two bedroom apartment” doesn’t require a front door to be called a two bedroom apartment. I was also told that heat is not mandatory in the apartments you rent from AirBNB."
1,"We had an absolutely nice stay at Andrea's. She is very friendly and helpful and tried to make our time in Amsterdam as nice as possible.
At the first day she welcomed us with a delicious dinner and the room was very clean. We could use the bathroom whenever we wanted to (so we almost didn't notice that the bathroom was shared).
The room is in a nice area with a park but there are mostly Africans living there. There is a supermarket just a few minutes walk away and you can reach the centre of Amsterdam in 20 min. by the metro or in 30 min. by bike. There aren't many restaurants near by the location so you have to go a bit further to eat out but you can have nice meals in the room as well.
I would definitely recommend to book Andrea's room!"
0,"It was ok.
Only bad thing was to share the bathroom and toilet."
-1,"The place is clean and more or less comfortable for three people. All the appliances were working as expected and all the kitchen elements needed where there.

Yet the sofa bed is not comfortable at all ; my wife and I didn't sleep well there and the cushions used as pillows were rather flat and it felt like not having pillows at all. 

Keep in mind that there is no stove or microwave, so it is impossible to warm food there.

Though it's advertised accurately, we don't think we'd be back there again given the chance of going back to Amsterdam. One ends up paying a lot of money for rent, food AND transport. Not a good deal."
-1,"In the lead up to our trip the host completely blanked all of our questions and messages. In the end we were that worried and in the dark over our stay and check in we contacted air bnb and he finally got back to us on the day we travelled. The apartment was nice but the bedding had stains on it and the towels were small and dirty. Then to top it off the boiler packed in and we had no hot water for the last night and next morning of our Stay, with the neighbour from upstairs contestantly knocking to try to fix it. We asked for a refund of less than 20% of what we payed which Christiaan refused to pay. We were left feeling upset and conned to be honest. Not good. I’m not a moaner this is the first time Iv left a review in my life but this hosts service was awful and left a bad taste on what was otherwise a great trip 👎🏽👎🏽"
1,"We didn’t actually meet our hosts during our stay but the houseboat was easy to find, accurate in description and a lovely experience. I would definitely stay with them again and highly recommend them!"
-1,"I really do not know how to explain the situation that my friend and me had with this guy... Definitely I dont recommend anyone to stay at his house. He has a very big problem... alcoholism.
We arrived at 9pm at his house and was completely drunk, disoriented, and of course the room wasn't make up. he said that he did not know that we're going to arrive... Anyways i would not recommend this bad experience to nobady so that is the reason I am sharing this with all of you. Hopefully we found a nice hostel in the center, but during a few hours we're in the street, in the night, with no place to sleep and was quite cold... Try to find another place guys! Amsterdam is very beutiful and this men has to solve his own problems.
"
-1,"Terrible service They arrived to receive us more than half an hour late, we had tu call him. They did not warn on the page that they had to climb four floors of very narrow stairs. The stove did not work and there were no cutlery or cups for four people. The luggage storage service was a scam, they did not open the store. The communication with the manager was inefficient."
1,"This apartment is just perfect, don't remember the last time I had ""home away from home"" feelings. The photos are 100% true, so there's no need to say anything else and you'll get exactly what you see on that pics.
NB the building is classic and old so you might get some ""advice""  from the upstairs neighbor"

1,Our first Airbnb adventure went very nice without any problems. Nice flat with several good restaurants in the same street. Thanks Veronica. 
-1,"SHADY, Do not recommend.
We had an accidental coffee spill on the rug, went out to buy an over the counter carpet cleaner and it came off quickly. We were honest and alerted the hosting agency of the spill the minute it happened. Walter claims it did not come off and is requesting for $608.11 USD to pay for the small rug. I booked based on the good reviews but regret it now because it feels like a scam. The rug is over 4yrs old, it does not make sense to replace the whole thing when he can hire professional cleaners. We actually paid for cleaning when booking the place too. We are not professional cleaners but the stain did come off when we use an over the counter product that costed 8 euros. Waiting for Airbnb to step in to access the issue but i would say if you stay at this place be very careful and don't get scammed, it feels like they are looking for chances to pocket your money."
1,Jan was such a nice and fantastic host! He made check in and checkout so fantastic and was flexible when a member of our party needed a room for one more night unexpectedly.  He was always accessible.  The room was humongous and fantastic and in a really perfect location 
0,"The listing looks nice, the photos can fool you a bit.
We were forced to sign a contract with KeyOkay, the company that manages this listing, as it appears.
In order to enter this listing, you have to go thru 4 locked doors and an elevator.
The bed and sofa mattress' are done for, they sink awfully and should be replaced.
The bathroom looks and feels great, the number one room in this house (the shampoo was missing).
The closet in-front of the bed was a bit broken, as non of the doors won't shut, it should be fixed.
The location is perfect."
1,"Nickys place was everthing thats advertised and more.  

Location perfect with all stores you need and laundry within a 2 minute walk and all Amsterdam tourist adventures within 20min walk.  Restaurants galore near by - both healthy and unhealthy.  And great park only 10mins away.  You really felt like you were living like a local amongst the canals.

Quiet street; shower and bed in apartment both fantastic; and high ceilings keep place cool on hotter days.  Loved apartment"
1,"Sharon's apartment was lovely and clean. The apartment is in a great location with great food just around the corner. Burger Bar and Pasta Pasta deserve a nod for easily accessible deliciousness. Or walk along the Albert Cuypt Market in the mornings for fresh stroopwafels or warm poffertjes. 

However, some cons include : the master bedroom being spacious but the bedding uncomfortable, although spotless. There was also only the bedside lamps for light at night. The toilet (with the only shower/bathe) upstairs has no door so our party of three found it a bit tricky getting ready in the morning. And definitely those stairs. If you have big luggage it is quite a climb. Otherwise the three floor hike is something I would not recommend for elderly or those with weak knees.

The payoff once you enter the flat is worth it though. The natural light that streams in through the windows is heavenly and really makes the apartment a cosy place to stay. There were clean towels and a working fridge and microwave. 

Sharon's neighbour Paul was a so friendly and helpful and made checking in easy. Also, there is a big television for when you need a night in but the cable was out during our stay.  We sent Sharon a note and she sent Paul immediately round to sort it, which was a pleasant surprise. 

All in all a great place for a young couple or a small group of three. We had an extremely pleasant stay and would love to thank Sharon for her wonderful hospitality. "
1,Very much lived up to expectation. Great location too
1,"Tata was so sweet and had so many nice touches in the room. Very homey. The WiFi was awful here, though, so it made traveling a bit more difficult."
0,"Apartment was very clean and modern, great location. Close to many restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, public transportation, and on the edge of center city. Decent value. I would stay here again but the management company has an awful check-in process that is confusing with regards to when and where to meet. They are also generally unresponsive and late, meaning there was a signification period of time that I was stranded with luggage without knowing when I would be able to get the keys. If you stay here, I would recommend *calling* and confirming with them way ahead of time with arrangements to check-in."
-1,"it was really horrible experience i've ever had. because i booked this room and found the location. and the i was waiting almost 1 hour in front of this flat. but a guy walked up to me and he said 'here is wrong address. you need to go another house.' so i took buses two times it also took about 1 hour. it totally wasted of my time and the room was really terrible. there's not a shower room and the air bed was really awful. i don't recommand it. it was really really nightmare.
hey guy, if you see this review you;d better say apologise to me. you didn't noticed that room changed and i paid this room but i don't understand why it had to change.
"
-1,"We had both the apartment and the studio for our family with two grown up kids. You can't beat this place for location. An historic canal house on this famous street from the golden age. The place oozes history and the renovation conserves that ambience. The bathrooms and plumbing are great and the beds are comfy. There is heaps of space. 
Unfortunately the apartment is now in need of some TLC. The furniture is grubby and torn and the place feels uncared for. Being partly below ground, lighting is important but some of the light fittings didn't seem to be working. The smoke detector was in a drawer instead of on the ceiling. When we arrived, the dishwasher was full of dirty dishes and we later found that some of the dishes and cutlery in the cupboard were also dirty. The large cupboard under the kitchen sink was a clutter of cleaning equipment including two very smelly mops whose odour permeated the kitchen. Also a loose pile of what looked like rat bait. My guess was right, because when we used the cooker, a mouse came out from behind and scampered over the benches and shelves. 
It's such a pity because it would be a wonderful place if they had a tidy, conscientious cleaner and had the chairs recovered. 
Until then, I don't think I would stay there again."
1,"Jim sent his mother to welcome us and hand us the keys – which already tells a lot about how welcoming he is. He also answered our text messages quickly  and made sure we would have arrived safely and were feeling at home. Furthermore he left an awful lot of leaflets and guidebooks on the kitchen table and dutch cookies (can’t remember their name).
You couldn’t describe Jim’s flat better and the photographs on Airbnb look as if he had taken them the day before. The flat is very nice and we regret not having spent more time there. The balcony is facing the inner courtyard and you could even get a tan, because there is sunshine in the morning and afternoon. Neighbourhood was quiet, there is a shop the other side oft he road, a restaurant in the same building (we didn’t eat there) and a café down the road offering a good breakfast. 
"
1,"Location was great, close to several tram stops. Studio was clean and happy to receive the personal touches of stroopwaffles and wine upon check-in :) Communication with Robert was very easy and quick. Had a great stay in Amsterdam and hope to be back again!"
1,"Very nice apartment with a stunning rooftop! The place is very well decorated and clean, and Anouk was very helpful (very late arrival etc...). Great communication with her during our stay. Will recommend to anyone who wants to visit the city, easy to go erverywhere from the apartment. Thanks Anouk!"
-1,"Good place, bad experience. 

Jairo’s place is in a nice neighbourhood and clean but me and my girlfriend did not have a pleasant experience. 

Once we checked in there were additional stringent rules in a file containing a lot of pages that the host handed out when we checked in. 
From these rules, my Girlfriend was forced out from the bathroom exactly after 10 minutes. 
She was also called out from our room to mop the floor of the bathroom because there were a few drops of water on the bathroom floor. I too was counselled for brushing my teeth in a sink in the toilet (the bathroom was occupied) We understand to keep the place tidy but this made us feel like we were in boarding school. 
We stayed in airbnbs across our entire europe trip and for us, the host relationship dictates our experience."
0,Great location with easy access to trams and supermarket.  Well equipped kitchen.  Some issues  with cat hygiene.and linen on beds could do with upgrading.hostess is a very good communicator.
1,"Great location, the flat was lovely and our host was very welcoming and helpful."
1,"Nice place, adapt for the budget.
Draco and his family are really kind and nice.
Close to the station and close to the public transport to the center, even close to the night bus stop!
I would recommend it.

Only a suggestion...don't go to that Arab copy of KFC next the house because is awful!"
0,"The house is in a very good position closed to the center, to the Pijp  and most important museums.
The saloon and kitchen area are very nice and comfortable.
The remark is that the house was not really cleaned and tidy and we didn't have any place where to put our cloths, but for 2/3 days could be ok.
"
1,Super centric and super welcoming
1,"This was the first time using airbnb, and there couldn't had been a better choice than Andrea. She was so helpful with transportation and guidance to get around Amsterdam.  She is a lovely lady and you will not regret your stay here. My brother and I stayed with her and I cannot complain at all. Thank you Andrea!"
0,Mouse living in the kitchen
1,We had a great time in Amsterdam.We were also very happy with the choice of location can ´t think of a better one.The bus stop was only 1min walk and only 15min to get to the town.On the way back we always catch the night  (website hidden) was brilliant 5days in Amsterdam. Thank you very much Imani that we could stay in your lovely apartment!
1,Had a great time at Sammy's place!
-1,"Pros: Great location. They were kind enough to let us leave our luggage inside before our check-in time. 

Cons: Furnishings were old and Spartan. The worst thing was the fact that the place was unkept and dirty - hair and dust att the floor, dirty kitchen utensils and cupboards. This is ironic, considering they charged us the cleaning fee, and asked us to clean it after ourselves on our last day. Would NOT recommend. 

"
1,"Awesome boat, well equipped and felt very welcome. Thankyou!"
1,"Joke and Gerard’s entire place is very beautiful, and highly recommended. They are extremely hospitable, and provided a lot of information on nearby restaurants and stores. It was very special to experience life along the canals, and also the canal is lots of fun to swim in or lounge in the sun beside. The location is also very nice- a bit in a quieter area of Amsterdam, nearby a very funky and unique warf, and only a short ferry ride (which is free) across the water to central station. Anyone would definitely love it here!"
-1,"First of all, I haven't stayed at this place and can not say anything about the accommodation. 
The host wasn't able to give me the necessary information, confirm my arrival date or just answer my messages till the evening of my arrival. After the poor communication with the host I decided to stay somewhere else. Unfortunately I didn't get my money back. Overall it was a bad experience with Airbnb and the host. "
1,"a nice place in a great location. 
good people, great experience"
1,"Mark and Cynthia were very kind and helpful. They gave us toys for our little girl to play with and left us a welcome basket of food and drink. They offer cheap bicycle rental and other extras and offered lots of ides and suggestions of what to do in Amsterdam. 

The boat is cosy and comfortable and good value. It's in a central location, walkable to everything and close to trams. 

The weather was awful when we visited but the boat was a haven and the bedroom is super cosy. It was lovely to see the water lapping outside the window and to say hello to ducks and swans. 

The sofabed is comfortable and there is lots of bedding. The kitchen is compact and well-stocked. 

Thank you!"
-1,"Toilet and shower are very tiny. Bed was awful, the house is so humid."
-1,"Very bad experience; House is not clean and I had the worst experience of getting the key.

There has been mis-understanding in handing over the key; We contacted through msg; She asked what time will we come I said after 5 pm anytime is possible cause I have no plan for the day, I will be hanging around the city for sight seen; she said OK but turns out she thought I agreed to arrive at 5 pm. At 6:50pm I got message from her saying she has been waiting for me for 1 hour and she has to leave so she left the key at Starbucks nearby which close at 7pm. Knowing that I only got 10 min to get the key and I was 5 miles away from that Starbucks, I tried to figure out what happened and how can I get the key; however the owner seems to be very angry about me letting her to wait for that long and refused to provide any help; Any question I ask her she just reply with 'no': 'can I get another key?' 'no', 'can you call the Starbuck to let them wait till we arrive?' 'no', 'Can I call the Starbucks to let them hide the key somewhere?' 'no' 'How can I get the key?' 'no you can't' So I gave up contacting her; Luckily by 7pm I contacted the Starbucks and they say although they are closed but the stuff will be there for another 20 minutes for cleaning; so I rushed there and finally got the key... 

When I entered the room it was OK, not big but at least has enough beds as described; however the sheets are not so clean you can feel tiny things(I don't know what they are.. dirts?) on the main bed; I have to sweep the bed by hand before I can sleep; my friend told me the other bed is not clean either; not to say the main bed room smells like cigarette...

So overall I had a bad time that night; my intention is to stay in the city till night then go to the house for sleep; turns out I have to rush to the house for keys... I though she lives in the house and is flexible on my arrival time... She didn't tell me she will only be in the house for handing over the key at 5 pm ... It was OK I should be responsible for mis-communication too but the fact she didn't want to help me made me very sad; I know airbnb is not hotel service that will be available 24 *7 for checking in; yet the pain of getting the house key made me feel uncomfortable in choose this service."
1,"Wow. I don't even know what else to say. I use AirBNB often and have never had a bad experience. But this experience sets the bar VERY high. The space itself is very luxurious. It is a beautiful apartment with multiple rooms that are rented out to other AirBNB-ers. This room in particular was very bright and clean with a wonderful balcony and an unbelievable view of Amsterdam. The kitchen and bathroom facilities are shared with the other rooms in the apartment, but they are fully stocked and kept in pristine condition. In addition to the shared kitchen (by the way, when I say fully stocked I mean FULLY stocked- eggs, meat, bread, cheese, juice, beer, snacks, cereal- everything you could want and more), there are also mini fridges provided if you buy items that you don't want to share. There are laundry machines and detergent in the apartment provided for your use. The check-in process was the most informative I have ever encountered on AirBNB. Javier met us at the apartment, gave us a tour, and showed us how to use anything and everything we might need. He also provided us with two bicycles and a bus pass, so travel all around was a complete breeze! The shared facilities were great too, we ended up meeting so many people and had a great time. We had an incredible experience here!"
0,"Joey helped us out on short notice as we were let down with another booking, allowing us to book his place for just 1 night with only a few days notice. He was very welcoming and his apartments location was great.

However the quality of the spare beds was awful, the bed under the glass table was like a giant sponge and offered no support what-so-ever. Some proper mattresses would really improve this apartment and give a much better nights sleep."
1,"Great place!  Jan was a wonderful host-even brought us wine/cokes when we arrived. Easy walking to Rjiksmueum, lots of cute restaurants, and of course canals. Wish we could have stayed longer!!  Thanks Jan!"
-1,"Not a ”luxurious” apartment, average. Extremely hot in the summer, with little air circulation. Privacy is an issue especially if the weather is hot, light curtains in living room and close quarters with other apartments. Noisy, next to garbage disposal so loud trucks in the morning. Also drilling and construction currently happening. Left apartment early, felt too uncomfortable.

Hosts tried to help but delivered broken fan, were slow to respond, customer service and consideration is lacking.  Not everything was the host's fault but I had a bad experience and felt the apartment was bad value for money."
-1,"I would not recommend staying at this apartment to anyone! The apartment itself is okay, very dark and the host Rozy could not care less that you are even there. She made no effort in making my stay pleasant, did not make any room for me and the place was constantly messy, dirty and horribly uncomfortable. After discovering bed bug bites all over my body and the bed, Rozy could not care less. This place is infested. Even now weeks after the bites are still all over my body and are awful. The whole experience was horrible. Again, stay elsewhere unless you want to be bitten by bed bugs and feel alienated. The only positive was that J Carlos was happy to help out and agreed to a refund. However, I wish I never stayed here and I hope they do something to rectify the infestation, however, Rozy seemed not to care so I doubt it!!! "
-1,"Wouter was very unprofessional and wanted me to pay 15€ in cash because I came at 8.15 pm. The thing is, we talked by mail and he told me I can arrive until 9 pm without paying (because I had a lot of hours of train etc.).
So that was his first lying and he just told me ""I made a mistake""...... I had to talk a lot with him and negociate for not paying this fee (I gave him almost 600 € for the week by the way).

Moreover, he sends almost every day the same kind of messages to all of his guests (just changing the firstname) and NEVER replies my questions about things I needed.

I always had great trips with Airbnb and hosts, except with this guy. It is the FIRST TIME I will not recommend a host, despite the flat which was clean and pictures as advertised.

Première mauvaise expérience avec Airbnb vis à vis de cet hôte. Wouter a voulu me faire payer 15 € alors que nous nous étions entendus pour que je ne paye pas si j'arrivais avant 21h (arrivée 20h15).
J'ai du longtemps négocier pour ne pas avoir à payer (et j'allais lui donner presque 600 € pour mon séjour..).

Il envoie presque tous les jours des messages déjà préparés en changeant juste le prénom, et IGNORE totalement les questions importantes auxquelles je voulais qu'il me réponde.
Je suis très déçu et je ne recommande pas cet hôte, malgré l'appartement qui était propre et conforme aux photos."
0,"The apartment was in a great neighbourhood and the place was beautiful. Be prepared to get very familiar with your roommates, however; the bathroom doors are transparent. There was an extra fee for checking in late, and the host attempted to charge us more as apparently the gas was left on (it was on when we had arrived). Airbnb cleared up the issue, however. Proceed with caution."
0,"The apartment was as described and the location was in a quiet part of town.  I didn't find the apartment to be as clean as I would have liked. The utensils were dirty as well as a few plates.  Overall, it was an ok stay."
1,We had a lovely time. The house is nice and warm and very clean. Emil is a great host and was very helpful
-1,"Unfortunately the over experience we had on this apartment was quite poor, actually it was the most bad experience i had on my airBNB apartments over the years.

let's start:
we arrived to the apartment after Marcel (represents the apartment agency that works with the owner of the apartment), who was very nice and communicating during our entire stay , checked us in.

1. heating:
We arriveג to the apartment and guess what?? ~ apparently that 3 out of the 4 wall Gas heating in the apartment did not work(!), 3!. The only one who did was the one up stairs next to the window. my friend and especially his girlfriend was suffering from cold! cause it was really cold! so, in that case you expect the owner to tell you before you arrive that 3 out of 4 of the gas wall heating is not working right?? so ... NO, they don't do that, instead, they give you two small heaters to plug into the wall and tell you ""that's should do the work"", ARE you kidding me???? why?? why can't you just tell us before that it's gonna be very cold cause there is no heat! we wouldn't have book it!!! Ohh of course, people will not book it if they will know, so they just hide this information and give you small heater in a size of tablet and hope you'll survive enough, again ~ Why? the hard part is that it was not an accident cause 3 are not working plus they prepared some funny heater that should assist. let me tell you, it's not possible, not even as a joke, the maximum you can do with that is put it next to you while you are shaking and feel better, or put it on your legs that already warped with socks to feel the toes! while the hole apartment is still super cold and after three minutes you can't suffer this hit on your face. what a shame, what a way to laugh on people on their face, that's an outrage!

2. hygiene:

if it's only one of us, then you know, it might be from somewhere else, but three people that scratching?? 3??? out of 3?
it started like this, my friend woke up in the middle of the night with half of his chin red and bubbled, his GF woke up the day after with her entire arm red and scratched, i was embarrassed and didn't know what to tell them, i was ok!.. but only for the first night, i started to scratch as hell from the day 2 also, we went to pharmacy to buy things to handle this. i must admit and say that again Marcel was very communicating and curious which was nice, he also ordered a company during our stay so they'll check if there any problem, but they said they didn't find. so they say... can anyone argue with 3 scratched persons and herpes? so so so bad feeling where i find myself doing double and three wrappings for a pillow trying to maybe avoid this blanket or not touching this and that? what kind o vacation of that i was thinking to myself??

3. Cleanliness:
let's start and finish with open condoms packs under my bed ok?, should i say more? i don't want to tell you how it feels to sleep after you see that? and telling to myself ""Jisss and that's only what i saw, what with the things i didn't""  that apartment was not clean!

because i can't -  i'm giving the owner the right to publish all of my reviews, all of them, during all my years, i'm using airBNB for 6 years already and quite often, i don't have even 1 bad review, or alternatively i don't have any review about me that is not super positive, so i don't know what the owner will write, and even for me it's hard to write this because i understand it's someone livelihood, but as part of the airBNB community i belong, and as one that use other people reviews i must mentioned what i have experienced!

Look for the private messaging between me and the host 3 weeks before we arrived, where i explicitly asked him(!!!!!!) about the heating:

===========Natanel to Cesar===================
Feb 25, 2019
it's ok, i'm used to that i'm slow haha,

also if you'll read my reviews you'll see i'm taking high care of the places i'm staying, i was reading that that the place is nice located indeed, but also ""sleeping arrangements it was not quite up to my expectations"" and "" space should have been cleaner and better maintained than it was.""
can i ask what to be prepared for? is the sofa bed is comfortable to sleep over for 4 nights or i'll end after 2  nights i'll start to feel my back? is the place clean? no heating/cooling or hot water issues? like can you please tell me (if there are of course) any lacks i should know before?

thanks a head of course :) :)

Hi Netenal

Actually this week there will be a complete new sofa bed. You can definitely sleep on this for  4 or 5 nights without any problems.   The cleaning is good.  The girl who wrote this had some other issues and lashed out.  But I can assure you the house is nice and clean.  There is central heating and warm water of course.  As we live in a cold country nobody here has airco.  There are no isssues.   

The place is good and comfortable:)

Rgds

===================================================


you get it? i'm asking about the heating and he says all is ok while 3 out of 4 was not working, so help me god.


My recommendation to you is to stay away from that place of course.

the location is quite good and central, 10 min from Albert Koyp market and 10 min' from the flowers market."
1,"Alexandra was very helpful from the very beginning, when I was travelling and had problems to connect to the internet and confirm the reservation. The apartment is new, spotlessly clean and very confortable: I can say that because the weather was awful and we spent home more time then we had planned. The place is very central, walking distance from most of the targets. We also enjoyed very much the view on the channel. Highly recomended. Paolo"
-1,"Stayed in several Airbnbs, and although the neighborhood was great (block from the 14 bus) and the room spacious, the home didn't have the same welcoming feel as the other places. There was only 1 key, and there is a winding staircase, so be ready to carry your luggage up 3 flights. Also the walls were thin and you can hear TV until late. 

A few hours after I posted the above, ""neutral"" review, Max wrote up a pretty nasty one for me..it is really upsetting to read it and not true.
My friend and I went to bed at 10pm and were out of the house the rest of the time, didn't use kitchen or living room, and the only time were heard is carrying up our suitcases moving in at 11am. We didn't know you can't be laughing on the staircase during the day. We were great hosts.  I feel it's appropriate to share his review of me here.

""Very loud and quite ""unpleasant"" guests. We never had a bad experiences till now this was our first one. But in general we could live with it. Not all people like everyone... I wish them more luck next time as they also didn't like us..."""
-1,"Not usually one to write a bad review, however this was a very disappointing stay. 

If the owners aren’t home they don’t care. And the people that look after the room for them while they are away are impossible to contact. Don’t bother ringing them because they don’t pick up the phone, they only reply through text. Their responses are either slow or none at all. It’s a shame that we wasted half our holiday trying to contact the people that looked after this Airbnb room. We were really looking forward to Amsterdam, and we left with nothing but disappointment and distress for a number of reasons. 

ROOM NOT CLEANED
Our room wasn’t cleaned until 5 hours after check-in time. They finally organised the cleaners to come at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. First day in Amsterdam absolutely wasted. We had booked a bike tour as well but had to cancel and reschedule due to endless attempts in trying to contact someone about our room. The cleaners had to rush their job as it was not part of their cleaning schedule. 

BIKES WERE NOT INCLUDED
We were promised bikes, however days before our stay we were informed that we were unable to use them as the owners were going away. We only chose this accomodation as we asked prior to booking if they were included and owners said we could use them. Disappointed we didn’t get the bikes. We were forced to book a bike tour. 

VERY POOR COMMUNICATION
Nina and Benjamin were away and left their Airbnb room to a third party to hand over the keys. The Third Party were impossible to contact. The Manager never answered phone calls so don’t waste your time. We spent the whole first day trying to contact anyone connected to our Airbnb room to find out what was going on. Response time was awfully slow and which heavily cut into our short 2 night stay in Amsterdam. This forced us to cancel our bike tour and reschedule our whole itinerary. It was impossible to communicate with Nina and Benjamin, the third party organisation looking after the room and the cleaners.

Until now we have not heard any response from them. Overall, it’s clear to say that my friend and I were disappointed, distressed and dissatisfied with this Airbnb room."
1,"Flat is according description on Air BnB. Very good location, tram just downstairs, 10 min from the centre. 
Clean, nice little flat, and small terrace very lovely. Just a point though staircases are really narrow and really high. It was absolutely fine for us, but just mentioning this in case of people having difficulties to walk up stairs."
1,"Kevin was an awesome host. Prompt reply, full of information for new comers, house well stocked with basic cooking amenities. We found some fruits and other eatables which was very helpful as we dint have to rush to grocery store immediately. His mom was kind enough to let us in when we got locked out 😁
Thank you, 
Vidya"
1,"Spacious, wonderful and big apartment with a beautiful rooftop terrace. The apartment is very stylish and comfortable. Communication with our host was perfect. "
-1,"It was awful. It seems that it was the house for homeless. There was a horrible smell of piss. The heating system wasn't enough for comfortable staying. AND NOW I SHOULD BE AT WORK WITH FLU. Seba arrived late. Also we didn't have toilet. I totally will not reccomend to visit this ""house"""
1,"The area is super nice! We found the location very lovely and had no problems with the check in and check out. 
As holidays, it might be nicer to know before the second floor was under construction big part of the day starting since morning. But besides it, We found the place lovely."
1,"Really nice flat - very spacious, clean and very good location! Raoul also made sure everything was really easy and seamless in terms of directions to the flat and getting the keys to us as well. Would def recommend.

Just in the interest of giving honest feedback - I would flag that the mattress is VERY soft, and really not recommended if you have a bad back at all. Also the internet is on the slow side. 
"
-1,"They called an hour before arrival from an agency, saying they couldn't find the key!
Absolutely awful! We called two weeks in advance; everything was fine. Two days in advance; everything was fine. The same morning; everything was fine! Then hey call us from the airport to say that the key is lost and offering a much worse accomodation. Everything was fully booked. The new place was only ment for 2 people and we were three. There were old smelly flowers on the table with mould in the water, silver fishes in the bathroom, dish in the dishwasher and the bedroom and the second small tiny room with a single bed was separated by a paper wall. I was also told that leaving a bad review would only fall back on me which is absolutely awful.

I think there was an agency involved so it might not have been Els herself but to not get back to me though I've left several text messages as well as tried to call is beyond unprofessional. I suppose the original appartment got rented out to a better price after I've booked it and the ""cant find key"" was a very lame excuse."
1,"My girlfriend and I spent 8 nights in Amsterdam with Carolina and we really enjoyed our stay. Carolina is a lovely lady, who was very welcoming, and was happy to answer any questions that we had. She is very knowledgeable regarding the city and knows all about the best cafes and places to go out. 

Carolina keeps a nice cosy apartment, which is kept clean and tidy. The room is as described in the pictures and description, and despite my and my girlfriend's best efforts, Carolina tried to keep the room clean. All in all it is a lovely place to stay.
"
1,Emil is very nice person. He took care of us very nicely. He came to pick my brother and me at the main station. Every morning he bought breakfasts for us. The room and rest of his flat was perfectly clean and tidy. We were very satisfied with his services! 
1,"Very good trip for us in Amsterdam, thanks to Judith who was a nice and helpfull host ! 
The appartment is very close to the bus, 15 min to be in the city center. "
1,"Staying at Coen’s place was definitely one of our best AirBnB experiences, and that is saying a lot as we’ve never had a bad experience. Communication was excellent all the way along, which goes a long way to calming any nerves about travelling to a different country and knowing what to expect. We had a couple of inexperienced / nervous travellers with us and the smoothness of this AirBnB experience helped tremendously. The place was spotless, stylish and very comfortable with a great sense of space. Check in was smooth even though our flight had been delayed by @ an hour. We really liked the area, and found it very easy to get everywhere we needed to be. Coen’s place is clearly a place where family life is lived with a lot of love and kindness, and it was lovely to stay there. Thanks very much to the family."
0,The place gave us both a good and bad experience. The bad - the shower wasn't working properly which was quiet frustrating. It seemed to be leaking. The apartment is also quiet empty. Very different from the images provided. The good - the apartment is in a fantastic location! We were able to walk every where we went. 
1,"The perfect flat for exploring Amsterdam! We stayed here for three weeks and loved our stay in Arnoud's apartment. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, walking distance to attractions, many restaurants and parks. The apartment was sparkling clean and had everything we needed to feel right at home. Arnoud also provided an amazing guidebook with the best local recommendations. Stay here!! "
-1,"This apartment is stunning but disappointing. In a fantastic area of Amsterdam, with amazing shops, bars and cafes nearby, however it's a bit tired and needs some repair.

We were really disappointed that the three bedrooms were not suitable for three couples. We felt the host hadn't been entirely honest as we had explained prior to booking that we were three couples and asked if we could see pictures of the third bedroom. We weren't sent any but we booked anyway as we fell in love with the balcony & host said the third room could have two beds pushed together. There aren't actually any double mattresses in any of the rooms as all beds are singles. The third room had day beds with sides which are no good for pushing together if you are over 6ft!

Our biggest issue was the two bedrooms upstairs had glass doors with no curtains or blinds so we had no privacy upstairs whatsoever. One room is a thoroughfare to the roof garden so again less privacy. There are also panes of glass missing so we could hear & see each other from our beds!! We drew straws for the rooms as the one on bottom floor is fabulous- more like a separate annex with it's own bathroom. Then upstairs had to make screens with blankets so we didn't watch each other sleep! The third couple were constantly disturbed by smokers needing access to the roof. 

In the plus side the area is difficult to beat with fab cafes, bars and clothes shops. The the kitchen/living area with incredible view is fab for a big group. But with the steep shiny stairs I'd not recommend young kids, and couples will have to accept no privacy for their time there which should be highlighted by the host. I think this is greatly overpriced compared to other three bed places on offer. Especially when the the main attraction is the fab roof garden that is plagued by wasps and only useable if you don't eat or drink. "
0,"Actually everyting fine. However it was a mess that we had to wait in the cold as EazyDrop missed to give us the right key.
Toilet is to be honestly not looking verfy friendly. Otherwise everything OK!"
1,"The listing description is completely accurate.  The neighborhood is quiet, charming and central at the same time.  Machteld is the most generous and thoughtful host imaginable.  She met me at 7:00 AM (wonderful since my flight arrived awfully early).  She had wine, cookies, a fantastic sweet bread waiting for me as well as suggesting anything in the larder was for my use.  The bed is comfortable, the shower is excellent, and the kitchen is exceptionally well equipped.  She arranged for a friend to give me a tour of Haarlem which was a highlight of my visit.  Her friend quickly seemed like my friend after a few minutes.  We had a wonderful time together.  During my 6 night stay, a cleaning lady was provided which wasn't necessary, but was very thoughtful.   There is, however, one caveat for people with vertigo or bad knees:  although there aren't many stairs, they stairs unusually steep.  This was not a problem at all for me. "
1,"Really enjoyed staying in Rick's loft. We had all amenities that we required, check in was very smooth, very clean and 10 minutes away from Vondel Park. Highly recommend this apartment."
0,"The location is basically the only selling point here. It's very central and perfect for easily exploring the city on foot. 
However, be warned, the whole apartment is filled with an awful stench coming from the bathroom. There is clearly an issue with the drainage and so there is a constant smell of raw sewage. 
Roger's description of the flat's size is truthful to be fair to him. It is a very small space so basically just a crash pad to come back to at the end of a long day. It's not particularly welcoming or homely, and coupled with the smell, meant that we didn't want to spend much time in the apartment itself. "
-1,"The apartment is like described, nice and cosy. But we had a bad surprise when opening the bathroom, as we noticed a really awful smell. Quite aggressive. After a while we were identifying a urine puddle next to the toilette.  So very unfortunately, it was up to us doing this disgusting cleaning and clear air afterwards.
On Saturday, there was raining a lot and the rain came through the closed window. All my documents (I had official documents in my bag) were damaged. This can of course happen, there was a big storm on this day in Amsterdam, but the problem is that I didn’t get any answer from the host when I related this problem. 
I am quite disappointed that both of the problems were not considered. 


"
-1,This is a small mobile home which is ok for two people. However it is very much in need of a good clean and some renovation. Chipped crockery isn't very nice and mildew in the shower room make it unpleasant to use. The drain blocked during our short stay and Reinhart seemed reluctant to deal with it. After a second request he did. And then we were left with no hot water and we were unable to get a response from Reinhart. He  never acknowledged our email about this problem. He didn't make personal contact with us at any stage. I was very disappointed with our stay. The pictures and reviews led me to believe it would be cute and cosy with a helpful host. I cannot recommend this place
1,"Losif very hospitable and jovial host, we were happy to stay with him. We settled in just a few hours, so we did not have time to look for other places. During this special thank you. The morning was tasty breakfast :)"
-1,"I recommend you not to go with airbnb- it is a scam - they have no real service and you will find yourself with no stuck with bed house no airbnb service!!!
First and last time with airbnb"
-1,"I would like to meet with the host in person, not with a third-party, who was representing the host. I have a feeling that the host even not living in the city and relies on the services hired by him.
The apartment is nice, beautifully furnished, but the description was not accurate. It is a ""look-out"" basement, not a ground floor apartment, which was very disappointing. We were forced to step down six steps every time in order to enter the apartment.
We weren't able to use the provided very complicated ""media center"" instead of a simple system to watch a local news on TV.  The laptop pictured in the photo was missing.
The bathroom did not have a tub, which is an expected amenity compared to the suggested price."
1,"Anna was extremely welcoming, albeit a bit wary of bringing people into her space. Due to her past bad experiences she only wants to bring people who will respect her house and her space. This place is not for people who want to party.

Living there was great. We were close to everything. Anna was great with communication.

I wish her the best for her Holiday."
0,"First of all it's not a room, Its a single bed in an office in a shop front with shutters covering the windows. Secondly the address Mirab provided was fake and it turned out to be a KFC restaurant. Once arriving at the KFC address and waiting over an hour for Mirab to reply I was asked take a bus 10 minutes away and meet his cousin at the bus stop at half past 3. I got there at half past 3 and after waiting for an hour decided to leave. I was eventually picked up by Mirabs cousin at 9pm that night. 

Bed and the toilet were both clean and there is cooking facilities and fridge. Mirabs cousin is a decent guy good to speak to."
1,"Nick and Olga were great hosts; friendly, approachable and extremely helpful. 

Their place is also conveniently located near a metro stop, with convenience stores and restaurants nearby. Their apartment was also very clean and neat, and the beds were excellent :).

Would definitely stay with them again if we come back to Amsterdam. Thanks alot Nick and Olga!"
1,"This is a very cool and pretty apartment with a great patio. The bedroom in the back is very quiet and opens onto the patio. It is very well situated with many shops and restaurants, as well as public transportation. Thanks Timo"
1,"I stayed here for 5 days at the end of April with four of my girlfriends.  The apartment is in a great location.  The market on the street below is very cool to peruse and shop.  Lots of great restaurants nearby (Bazaar was very good with a cool atmosphere but very slow.  The Thai restaurant was quite nice.)  The metro stop is a quick 5 minute walk through the market (longer if you're like me and can't resist stopping to look at all the interesting goods for sale!).  Vondelpark and the museum district are a nice stroll away.  

The apartment is very bright and airy which is nice.  The living room and dining area were ideal for us to hang out and converse.  There was plenty of room for the 5 of us though we did have to double up on beds.  We didn't run out of hot water so that was nice.

Bed situation: 1 decent queen in a room with 1 slanty twin bed that wasn't the best, 1 decent double bed in a room with another not so great twin bed and 1 mattress pad in a ""loft"" that only a young boy would want to attempt climbing up to.

Alisa & Piet were out of town so we were greeted by Matthys who thankfully took our heavy luggage up the very narrow and steep set of 4 stairs to the apartment.  He was very friendly and helpful, showed us around the apartment and had some nice recommendations on things to do.  The welcome bottle of wine was a nice touch.

The not-so-good:  as some have mentioned, the pictures must be old.  The furniture and bedding is definitely on the shabby side - not awful though and the bedding smelled fresh and clean.  Something in the kitchen/bathroom area smelled like sewage the whole time we were there.  I think there is a plumbing issue.  The kitchen is pretty sparse on utensils, glasses and plates, so keep that in mind if you're planning on doing any cooking.  The bathroom upstairs is open with just a shower curtain so privacy is an illusion.  Bathroom noises travel into the bedrooms easily.

All said, it was worth the price and I would stay there again."
-1,"Bad experience. There were several problems that occurred. First of all, the indicated address was not right. I called them, but as they wouldn't answer the call, it took me an additional half hour to find the place. 
Then I realized that they wouldn't sleep in the same apartment. They rented the 3 rooms and left the apartment. Then I realized that the bedding sheets had not been washed. There was some sort of fluid dried out and hardened on the sheets. I called them, and they told me that I should simply take out the dirty sheet and sleep on the mattress protection. But that was dirty too at the same spot. Then I convinced myself to sleep on the dirty sheets, but I couldn't because a noisy party started on the flat just above. At 4 am,  the heating was so hot that we needed to open the windows. I slept very little during the night and was very tired the next day. "
1,"I spent my last day at the Pirate Ship Hostel after a week in Amsterdam and had a great experience. It was the exact relaxing atmosphere and serene surroundings that I needed after a week in the city. One of Hali's workers, Christoph, greeted me upon my arrival and showed me around. He was very welcoming and I really enjoyed talking with him. I would definitely recommend this for travelers looking for accommodations off the beaten path. My only warning would be that I stayed here in October and it was awfully cold at night, even with the sleeping bag and blankets provided on board. I would suggest coming earlier in the summer season or at least come prepared to sleep in layers."
0,"One week vacation on Mario's boat.  Wanted to live a ""different"" experience.  Maybe it was not for us.   The boat is spacious and pictures do represent what you get.  In our case (this is important and is only following our own experience there), we lived through painfully noisy nights (no sleep or very little).  I guess the gooses or ducks in the canal were in full ""spring"" season and kept us awake.  There was also a motor that look like it was under the bedroom oppposite to the kitchen and kept banging a whole night.  As others have said, the shower is also a bit special.

Some things also need a bit more cleaning concentration, coffee pot, glass in the bathroom, etc.

All in all, not a bad experience at all.  Max was very polite and helpfull.  In the final analisys, my remark would be if you like the basic summer (water and sewer pump, etc) home type of thing, this might be for you.      "
1,"Overall we had a fantastic stay.

We arrived an hour later than expected, and Ewa was friendly and accommodating, despite our being tardy! 

The apartment is very nice, and the space is well organised, making it feel larger and more spacious. 

We were worried about the bed, as sometimes sofa beds can be awful, but it was really really comfy!!

The toilet and shower aren't in a separate room, and have a curtain across them. As a couple this wasn't an issue at all, and it says this in the bio too, but just to reiterate that you want to be comfortable with the person you're going with! 

Ewa was great at staying in touch, any time I had a question she replied straight away.

The apartment was very hot, as its on the fourth floor - Amsterdam was unusually hot (30C) when we visited, but just something to be aware of. 

Someone on the floor below us did leave a bag of rubbish in the corridor for two days. In the heat, the smell got so bad that we moved it on the third day! Of course, there's nothing Ewa could have done about this, but just to note it. 

The fridge either didn't work or just wasn't powerful enough, as our milk went off after about a day, so we started buying ice to keep things cold. Not an issue at all if you don't plan to get perishable food :)

We had a great time. Ewa recommended renting bikes, which was brilliant advice. The apartment is 20 minutes cycle from the city centre, and right beside a beautiful park. There's also a few restaurants close by if you don't want to travel far. 

Thanks so much Ewa, we had a lovely holiday."
1,"with my friend really liked the place, like on the picture. Carolina was away during our short stay, but her friend Nnanna was very friendly, showed us amsterdam and night life, we had really nice stay there, the place is not that far from centre and there is a minute away bus day and night, which is nice. We recomend the stay there."
1,"From the moment we booked the apartment we knew we had booked the perfect place! Eveline was incredibly attentive throughout and made us feel at ease. Her apartment is PERFECT. She has seriously thought of everything and it is so comfortable and homely. The apartment is situated in a really great area near to shops for food shopping and also the number 7 tram outside takes you straight in to Amsterdam itself.

We cannot thank her more - fantastic host gorgeous property what more can we ask for! "
-1,"The check-in process is bad and you need to pick up your keys from a business 5 minutes walk from the central train station even if you aren't traveling by train. The pick-up location is roughly a 15 min cab ride or 35-40 min walk to the airbnb. We had expected a personal check-in but this wasn't the case. 

Our wifi was also broken 30 minutes after we arrived and we couldn't use it the remainder of our stay because it was never repaired although we communicated it frequently to our host. This was our biggest issue, because we rely on wifi to plan our days and communicate back home. It really hurt our Amsterdam experience.

The location is wonderful and in a nice part of town near the center, but not too touristy.

I put service and communication above all else when choosing an airbnb. The reviews of this place are excellent and that's why we decided to stay. We feel really disappointed in the service and support during our stay, which is what we value so much about our stays in airbnb. We will consider other accommodation options after this experience.

Michael & Katie"
-1,"VERY BAD EXPERIENCE! First of all, the stairs to the building is a nightmare!!! We all know that stairs in Amsterdam are steep and narrow but for this one, you literally need to climb!!! Not walk.
Also, Peter, the host, who seemed like a nice guy before, never met us, we never saw him. After we entered the place we realized that some things are not as we discussed, so I called Peter and he said he will call me back in 1 hour. Never called. The day after I called him again, he said he will call me back after checking the email conversation (apparently you don't email with Peter, you communicate with someone who works for him, so he doesn't have any idea whats going on) and I had to call him again to get a response from him.  This apartment was VERY POOR AND NOT SATISFACTORY!!! I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT STAY HERE. ITS NOT LIKE HOW IT LOOKS ON THE PHOTOS."
-1,"My stay at the Shiren house was difficult especially at sleeping time. The hostess kept the thermostat located in her living room at the temperature of  19-20 °. Despite having asked 3 nights in a row for Shiren to raise the temperature, she explained that if she increased it, she would not be able to sleep. It was a very bad experience."
0,"This spot is in a great location. I loved being close to the park and several restaurants. However, a few things to know. The room is advertised as a private room. It is in a home and getting to the room is in a shared hallway. At one point during our stay someone walked into our room without knocking. It is important to keep the door locked at all times. Additionally the toilet was in a shared hallway but when advertised it seemed as though it was in the room and private. The shower area was in our room and private. There are also very steep stairs getting up into the room so if you have any sort conditions making it difficult to climb stairs I would not recommend staying here. Overall I felt underwhelmed but it did not negatively impact my experience in Amsterdam. If you don't want to spend a lot of time in the airbnb and want to stay in a great location then I would recommend this."
1,The Bedroom space is good and the bed is quite big and good. The place is five minutes walking from the central station. Very well located. You can’t expect a quit place since there are a lot of bars and restaurants beside it. Yuray was a very good host.
1,"We were very comfortable in your (website hidden) was very tidy and clean. We left it as well as we found it. We had everything we needed for a nice stay. It was a pity we couldn't enjoy your garden, the weather was awful those days. If we ever go back to Amsterdan we will be pleased to book at Reinhart's again.

"
1,"The place is really nice, we passed a good night, we're close to central station ( and the center of the city by extension) and the reception was really nice too :) Its a good place you can go in!"
-1,"A man nammed Sammy gave us the key to the appartment. A really short and quick tour of the appartment was given. He asked us if we had any questions and I couldn't think of any while he was here. 
When I was booking this appartment (I must of wrongly understood and read) I thought this appartment would have 2 bedrooms as it was writen in French ""2 chambres"". There is actually 1 real bedroom and 1 livingroom where there is a small sofa bed. I assure you that not big people can fit in... the top of the bed is hard wood and the matress is short (less than 1m60 long) and it lays right above the floor.
The big sofa was covered by cat hair so people who are allergic be aware of that ...
The restrooms were really smelly even if they seemed clean. The fridge was also smelly.
We couldn't find any products to clean the restrooms.. the appartment was really empty. There were no soap except the one for dish washing. 


At least the appartment is in a really good area ""de Pijp"". Everything and everywhere is walkable from this appartment to the touristic places in de Pijp. The tram number 4 is less than 5 min walk and it goes straight to central."
-1,"The house was awfully dirty. We found rat droppings in the kitchen. Really bad. Have lots of pictures. Shower doesn't work, sheets dirty and so pillows"
1,"Great apartment, centrally located but not in the touristic area. Within  walking distance of shops, and the city center if you like walking. Spacious, nicely decorated with a roof terrace. All  necessary information concerning the use of kitchen appliances and equipments  is printed out and the host welcomed us with a bottle of red wine. We had a great stay there and we enjoyed Amsterdam very much. "
-1,"As a longtime AirBnB user it has finally happened: my first terrible experience on AirBnB where I felt as unwelcome as water in a leaking ship. Now it's clear to me why the host is the most important part of the AirBnb experience. I've stayed with hosts whose properties were much older with much less wanna-be design elements, but who provided an experience like no other: caring, friendly, polite and accommodating. As one can see from our reviews, we take our responsibility as AirBnB guests extremely serious, always stay civil in communications and take excellent care of the properties we stay in as if they were our own. 

- This host should not rent out her place on AirBnB if she is THIS squeamish about normal wear and tear. There are no surfaces in the apartment to hang or place things like keys, jewelry, books, purses so I put them on the dining table which elicited a barrage via email on how the (IKEA) table would be scratched.

- Even though I cleaned up a stain that this host was adamant would not come out, she still reported it with old pictures from before I removed the stain in order to tack on the deposit to the rental fees. Her communication about this during my stay was downright rude (onbeschoft is the word in Dutch) as if I smeared her walls with excrement. Totally uncalled for. 

- The bedding smelled awful, so I had to wash it and while washing it pulled out another comforter out of the closet to cover while sleeping. No good. Another scathing remark via email.

- There is zero cellphone reception inside and very poor wi-fi connectivity. 

- There were perishables in the fridge that didn't smell too nice. 

- When I suggested to do a walk-through together before check-out she refused to accommodate at a time that would work for me so I wouldn't miss my flight, again via a quite pedantic email, but proceeded to enter the apartment without my knowledge the night before. 

The location is alright, however, there are much better ones in Amsterdam that are just as calm, but don't require the extra time to and from the Centraal Station and where you can walk to a bar, restaurant, park or other interesting activity that is key to Amsterdam city life. This neighborhood is suburbia.
If you insist on staying in this location, make sure you find another property with an experienced and amenable AirBnb host. "
0,"Location is good, and the flat is modern, however the undergroud bedroom heating system was not working in addition to the relevant bathroom. ( flooded ) 
Additionally, the stairs to reach the flat and inside the apartment are awful. 

Overall, the flat is overpriced taking into consideration that only half of the facilities were used ( only 1 bedroom and bathroom)"
0,Evertything ok! Bed was awful though!
-1,"Small basement apartment (no kitchen) in central location, as shown in listing. What you can't tell from the listing is you hear every word and movement from the tenants on the main floor as if they were in the same room as you, like having roomates.  If you intend on sleeping that will be contingent on what they're up to, and they like to party.  The bathroom is also pretty gross. I've used airbnb throughout Europe and live in a townhouse at home so I'm used to hearing neighbors but this was pretty awful"
1,"Thomas and his apartment were all around great. We got out of a booking we found out to be a scam last minute and Thomas was more than happy to make room for us. Warm and welcoming, he gave great tips and made sure we were more than comfortable during our stay in Amsterdam! The apartment (with some steep, but fun stairs) was in a great spot, close to the buses and canals. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
1,We had a lovely stay. The apartment is beautiful and filled with so many personal touches. The neighbourhood is lovely and quiet at night but restaurants and grocery stores are still close within walking distance. We would highly recommend booking here! 
1,"We had a very pleasant stay. The apartment is very nice, the surroundings are very beautiful and it's very close to the bus stop. We found that the location was ideal: away from the crowded and noisy center, but still easy enough to get there by bus (20 minutes). 

One thing that bothered us was the bed: the mattress is quite old and uncomfortable. Other thing that could be improved is the shower. 

Apart from those details, we had a great time and we would definitely recommend it. "
1,Imani is very nice and kind and the house is beautiful and cleaned!!! The neighborhood is quite and nice!! I would suggest this place!!
1,"Staying with Ana was great! She was really Nice, her apartment was clean and there was milk, cereal, tea and water in our room! She let us use everything we needed and helped us a lot. She gave us a map with Ferry timetables and restaurants. We had Some pretty bad experience with other Airbnbs, but this one was really awesome! Si if you are going to Amsterdam you Should stay with lovely Ana:)"
1,"Tjeerds house is in a really lovely area. Really easy to get anywhere in Amsterdam from there.
Also Tjeerd was by far the best host i had to date :)"
1,Sander was very responsive and flexible (my flight delayed and he handed over the keys personally still later that day). The apartment is very nice and clean. Great for 1-2 persons who are looking to spend time in Amsterdam. Can only recommend this place. 
1,"The location is convenient and the living arrangement is lovely and comfortable. We also appreciate the laminated map (with the boat picture) to direct our walk to the destination, as well as the Welcome Manual that included instructions for the washer/dryer..and restaurants and super market.
We did have a fun dining experience at Semo Sabo Indonesian restaurant. But would not recommend the Mexican Burrito to anyone. Although the service was commendible, the meal (fajitas for two) was disappointing.
We did cook dinner and breakfast, so it was nice to have the spacious galley and seasonings in the drawer. The kitchen is well stocked for vacationers, and everything worked.
Other than the pictures and description when considering accommodations, the washer was the reason we chose this Classy Houseboat, since this is a month journey. We were thrilled that it also has a dryer!
We really regretted leaving this floting hotel. It was a memorable experience! 
Very organized and thorough pre- and during correspondence, and easy check-out. A Definite Must!"
1,"The trip to Amsterdam was a special treat to my boyfriend for his birthday and he was left speechless. The houseboat was a gorgeous place to stay in Amsterdam, very characteristic, very picturesque. Magnificent. I couldn't have made a better choice. And even though the weather was awful-cold,windy and rainy -10C in the end of July, we felt great on the houseboat.  Klaas was very helpful and hospitable, made us feel at home. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to go beyond the experience of a usual vacation."
-1,"We were a little disappointed by this B&B, considering the relative hight price and the offer.
The reception with Riks was kind, but globally very minimalist : only contact at the arrival for few minutes explanations and delivery of keys. 
Our room was very small (shower room +Wc in it too) for two, and we missed place for luggages and things.
Also the breakfast/buffet, to prepare yourself, could be more well-kept with some better products quality (jam, ham, bread). 
Good points : the situation in the area is very practical and attractive, nice old house, the kitchen is really a nice large room with canal view."
1,Great location in a nice neighborhood. Walked from central Amsterdam and back!
1,The room is really cosy and the appartment very nice. The pictures are very truthfull and the garden is great. The area is very relaxed and quiet but close to the center (buses run all night and during the day several buses serve the area). Carolina was away for the period we were over but Nnanna was very helpful and kind. I recommend this place for sure!
-1,"Overall very bad experience due to several reasons! 
1. In the pictures Rosie shows almost her whole house but actually the spaces where you can really go are only the small room with the bed and the bathroom.
2. The bathroom was not private and we had to share it with other people!
3. When we arrived, she didn`t even come to welcome us downstairs but let us come up all alone where we met her in her kitchen...
4. The first thing she did when we arrived was explaining the strict house rules in a very rude and uncomfortable way, we felt like little kids listening to the teacher. Actually she should know that I am a very good AirBNB user if she took a look at my reviews.
5. The worst thing was that she called me one day before to say I had to pay her 18 EUR extra cash because Airbnb made a mistake. Of course I said that I didn`t accept that as Airbnb is super correct. After that I told her I don`t want to come anymore because I felt like it was a scam.. But she convinced me to still come as she understood my point.
6. On the day we had to leave she send me several messages to tell me that I had to leave on time. She even came in the room when we were still there without knocking on the door! After that she came up again to see if we were packing or not.. Completely crazy and we felt not comfortable at all knowing that we were not late at all leaving the airbnb! 

Overall I felt like she tried to control everything and her way of communication was very straight and rude. My girlfriend didn`t have a comfortable trip in Amsterdam all because of her so I strongly recommend Airbnb to have a talk with her and I really don`t understand how she can have good reviews... Her behaviour didn`t match with the reviews that I read before. And she had no reason to act like that as I am a regular Airbnb user with only good reviews!"
1,"Imany was really nice! We enjoyed staying at her place.

The only thing is that apartment is a bit far from center."
-1,The shower was completely clogged up and the host did nothing to solve the problem. The kitchen stuff were all dirty and there wasn't even a clean sponge to wash the dishes. The radiator was broken and even though we notified the host several times of all of these problems she did nothing. This was truly awful and we want our asking price back. You/the firm or what ever it is you run should we prohibited of renting out this boat. 4 people did not get to shower in FIVE days on the boat!!! We had to check into a hotel to be able to use their shower. 
1,"I had the most pleasure to have come across a most welcoming and nice host - and his stunning apartment in Joordan.  Rene was very helpful and considerate of my requests.  The apartment was very clean, spacious and well-appointed - with fresh flowers and fruits from Rene.  I was sincerely touched.   Very comfortable bed, fluffy pillows and clean sheets.  The location is unbeatable, the apartment's in a most desirable neighborhood close to all conveniences.  I highly recommend!  And Rene, thanks!"
1,great apartment very near to the center nice hosting :) would come back of course!
0,"This apartment was honestly great in most parts. 

Location is amazing. 
The place itself was very nice and comfortable. 
Everything you need is close by and a perfect place to stay if you are visiting Amsterdam on vacation. 

On the negative side 

The stairs in the building and to get to the unit are simply terrible. Very narrow, small and curving steps. Not easy at all to go up or down, especially with luggage. 

The wifi signal was awful. The renter clearly has another unit in the building that he rents out. I assumed that the wifi router is in that other unit, because I could not find it and the wifi signal was stronger at the bottom floor of the building than my unit on the top (4th) floor. This makes it difficult to do work or access internet if you rely on wifi signal. 

Other than those 2 factors, everything else was just fine. 
I would stay again, but not for as much $. The place is very simple and doesn't have any reason that it is close to 200$ per night. "
-1,well located quit location but price-performance ratio far below average.  If you consider the Bellamyplein to stay you will be far better of at the hotel 50m away for this Price.
-1,"Awful. Place was dirty and smelly. No sheets, I slept in the sofa with the hoodie on because of the dirt. There is"
1,"We enjoy the place. Even the host wasn't there when we arrived, It Was very simple to us to get to the apartment. It was very easy to go downtown and the kitchen Was very well equiped. We also like that there had Bluetooth for the music"
0,"A lovely little apartment in a good location. We loved the ambiance and the little balcony. The steps to get up and down are typical Dutch, small steps and very steep which was fun with bags. Our disappointment was that we could not get the washing machine to wash and dry as it was meant. Despite reporting this, no one came to fix it, so there was much hand washing, and the lovely little balcony was used to dry clothes.Had the machine worked, or been fixed, everything would have been great. "
1,"Really cool flat! Beautiful balcony, nice decoration, beautiful touches, real airbnb experience. Good location, quiet area with easy access to the city center by tram. Highly recommended and if I plan to come to Amsterdam again I would definitely stay at Anouk’s place!"
1,"It was an absolute delight to be hosted by Astrid. Her house was in a quiet and clean neighborhood. She welcomed us to her beautiful and tidy house. We were offered tea or coffee and our room was fully equipped with everything we needed. The bathroom was also equipped and sparkling clean. 

She quickly reacted to all of our requests and was always smiling. 

I will recommend her! 
"
0,"The house was very central, room was very nice, shower was really good. 

Only thing I didn't realize is that there's not a front door for the flat so you only lock your bedroom door so it's not really a full apartment as guests stay in the other room across the hall so it's more of a room to stay in.

A small fridge to keep food in, balcony would be lovely in the summer and very close to both Vondel and Rembrandtpark. Close to food shops and restaurants. The bikes were great to have.

Biggest downfall is Wifi was awful, could barely ever connect and even when I could connect it was very slow and cut out a lot.

I'd reccomend for the location as long as you're not reliant on Wifi"
1,"I had a great moment in Amsterdam, Thea's mother gave me good advices about the metro, tram.. And it helped me a lot not to be lost. The district they live in is safe and very beautiful, that was a real pleasure ! Yet, be careful at the airport, take the Time to check bus and trains for the centraal station (i had a bad experience with a taxi..). Just Enjoy Dam and have fun ! :) "
1,"Judit's studio was a great place to stay for several days. It's self-contained so you can make your own food and look after yourself. There is a supermarket across the street for all food and essentials. (Otherwise there's not much shopping nearby.) It's not too small and has a big picture window and a balcony so it doesn't feel crowded like some studios do. It's on the edge of Amsterdam so 15-20 min by bus to Centraal Station, or a good 20-30 minute cycle which is a good way to get some exercise. If cycling you take the ferry across the IJ, which is a nice way to slow down at the end of the day. Judit (and her sister) were very friendly and helpful. They live elsewhere but not far away. Overall a good place to stay if you don't want to be right in the centre of Amsterdam.     "
-1,"Apartment was hosted by bnbmanager, a 3rd party business, and not the apartment's owner, Martijn.

bnbmanager's service is awful and inaccessable to turists. The only way to reach them is by landline phone, which costs a lot of money."
-1,"This particular bnb was overpriced, as much as a decent hotel per night.   Half of the asking price would have been reasonable.  Apart from a good living room with nice views, there were many problems. The second room, described as twin bedded, is in fact a very small storage room with a noisy boiler in it and no room to stand at all if the second  bed is unfolded. Both beds were only suitable for children. This was very disappointing as the host knew we were 2 adult friends wanting, (and prepared to pay for),  separate bedrooms as well as a shared living room. The bedsheet in the main bedroom was awful (stretch nylon mesh), and there were many features of the bathroom (blocked sink, dismal lighting, many missing mosaic tiles, broken shower head) that needed radical attention and remediation.   The overall impression was that this was an attempt to make money without regard for service.   The advertising is  misleading.   Go to a hotel, or find a more scrupulous and responsible home-owner."
0,"Good place but the reception was awful, just as the wifi. Also they only spoke Spanish and Portuguese."
1,A nice night of stay! Emil is such a caring host that looks out for you from the minute of arrival. Comfy room in a quiet neighborhood away from the city but convenient via public transportation. Good times:)  
1,Great place. Surrounded by many shops and restaurants and a dog park!
1,"Andrea was an excellent host. She made us feel welcome for the entirety of our stay. In fact, before we arrived, she gave us some helpful tips and pointers about Amsterdam. On arrival, she was very warm and had lots of information about the area and things to do in and around Amsterdam. She even noticed that we were tired and weary after our early start and fed us almost immediately on very tasty Dutch cheese (with cumin inside!) and bread.
 
The room was as described – very comfortable, clean and it felt like our own place at times! It was really helpful to have use of wifi and access to the fridge to store breakfast and other food for our trips to the centre. The beds were comfortable and it made our luggage lighter knowing that Andrea would provide us with everything we needed for a good night’s slumber! J
 
The neighbourhood was interesting – a suburb of Amsterdam – easily commutable in about 20-30 minutes to most attractions (the Metro station was within five minutes’ walk and trains were very regular, running til late). The area itself was fairly urban, although Andrea’s flat was adjacent to wide open green spaces and cycle routes, which I imagine would be great to explore in the summer (though the weather in mid-February was too cold for us to fully exploit this).
 
Overall, our stay in Amsterdam couldn’t have been better, so thanks to Andrea for contributing!"
1,Location was excellent! A little noisy with the other guests but wasn’t too bad at all! The host was very helpful and friendly and they were very quick to respond. All in all a good stay - thank you !!
-1,"This was the first bad experience I had with Airbnb and it was pretty bad!  The trip was a birthday surprise, I chose a sunny, airy, pleasant 1 bedroom apartment and it was all the contrary.  The photos were completely misleading.  It was a dim studio that was poorly lit and dingy (among other things, mangled venetian blinds, light fixtures that didn’t turn on, one with 5 lights that only had one bulb in). 
The place was overfilled with personal stuff including shoes in corners, coat racks over piled with coats and nowhere to put ours, a large bag of dirty laundry in the cramped corner alongside the toilet in a tiny bathroom so dark you could barely see yourself in the mirror.  We were given 6” of hanging space and a tiny shelf to put our things in a closet that was stuffed to the gills.  The thermostat was fixed at 16 degrees.  You could raise heat but it would reset at 16 which meant you both woke up and came home to a cold house.   The situation was depressing and colored our 4 days in Amsterdam.   I’m sorry to report this, because the host could not have been kinder or more helpful and available with suggestions, but I wish someone else had written this and I had known about it."
-1,"DO NOT RECOMMEND DEALING WITH THESE HOSTS

They tried to scam us complaining about an emergency box being damaged that none of us ever came into contact with. Hosts complained about issues that were not present to try and scam us out of money. We paid a cleaning fee and still done the cleaning ourselves to which the host still complained and tried to get more money out of us. The list goes on with the many complaints we have about the apartment such as no fire alarm, blocked drains, builders from as early as 6am (not mentioned by host), hot water was very temperamental, dusty and dirty in more than a few places, bugs found in the bedroom, loud music until 3am from neighbouring bars that we were not warned about, Wi-Fi never worked for any of us on either our mobile devices or laptop, TV had poor signal so was rendered useless, ZERO basic amenities included, awful odour from the fridge which lingered throughout the whole lounge. This is the first terrible experience I’ve had after using Airbnb consistently for several years. My friends and I would strongly recommend against staying in this apartment or dealing with these scamming hosts."
1,"Great apartment and great location! Ronald is a very helpful, available  and organized host. Strongly recommended."
1,Very comfortable apartment. So nice there. All the time again. Perfekt is the right word.
1,"This place was amazing. At first we thought we were going to be far from the city center but it turned out to be very near and a much beautiful location. It had many restaurants, supermarkets, cafés, etc. 
The bedroom was very nice with several amenities such as coffee maker, kettle, hair dryer, among others. And the hospitality was awesome, they are a super nice Dutch couple that knows everything worthwhile knowing. They let us came before the check-in hour, lend us some cutlery and plates, rent us bikes at a very good price, and gave us a lot of tips to get to know the city. 
The only but of this place, is that the bathroom is divided, hence you have handwasher and shower in suite, but the toilette (which is private) is outside the bedroom in a share space with the owners. It wasn’t a bad experience or anything like that, but I think is good to let you know."
-1,"I just left Yvonne's house,me and 3 more friends of mine and we had a very bad experience in this house.When we arrived at the house we were expected from an Yvonne's friend.When we get into the house we realised that it was beneath of our (email hidden) the pictures the house looks better and bigger.The second day  of our holiday we found RATS.We tried to contact with Yvonne but she was abroad and she didn't answer her (website hidden),we had to buy (email hidden) the time we left it,it had rats.I strongly don't recomment it.Even all these,Amsterdam was great,i suggest it to everyone.Also,airbnb was very supportive.I hope that i was very enlighting about this appartment. 
and if anyone wants to rent it,BE CAREFUL."
1,Hi. Hilde’s space was great and decorative. I felt right at home and my host was able to communicate with me in a timely manner. I enjoyed  my stay and everything seemed so close. I would definitely recommend this place for your trip here.
1,"I like to recommended to anyone, firstly this my first time book Airbnb I thought it would be a issue where my friend had bad experiences. I travel a lot staying at 5 star hotel. Around the world . The hospitality from Stephen and property you can’t ask for more. Anyone visit Amsterdam look up for this property.  Thank you Stephen I which I can stay longer."
-1,"Terrible bed! 
The apartment is comfortable and, even far from the city center is nice. 
However, the bed is awful! There are two different mattress and it so soft, our back hurt those days.
The apartment is rent by an agency, with more than 40 entrances on friday, so arranging the check in schedule and reaching the host on bussy days is difficult."
1,"Great area, lively neighbourhood, lovely houseboat. Would stay again. "
1,"Pam's home in Nord is absolutely lovely! Perfect for a couple. The neighborhood could not be more adorable, and even from the furthest part of town only about a 30€ cab fare. (The weather was awful, so we took cabs more than we normally would.) however, public transport, walking, or cycling are all great options to get into the city center as well. I've already recommended this place to several friends planning on weekends I'm Amsterdam. Thank you, Pam!"
1,"the room is cute as the description, and it's easy to reach from the airport and central station.
we had a pleasant stay there."
0,"My opinion of this apartment is mixed.  It certainly has some positive features.  The location in the  Pijp is very good – it’s a lively area full of cafes and restaurants, within walking distance of the centre of the city.  Despite all those bars and cafes, the apartment is generally quiet at night.  It’s a good size and quite well furnished, the bed is large and comfortable, and the wifi works well (although not everywhere).   There is a television with a range of channels, including a number of non-Dutch stations (BBC and CNN for English speakers).  There is a perfectly functional kitchen and the arrival gift of wine and wafers was appreciated.  In general the response time of the managing agent (it’s clear that you are not dealing with the owner) is very good.  The person who met us was very nice and coped very well with transport delays which made us quite late.  However, there were a number of negative features.  The entrance is awful.  It’s obviously not the owner’s fault that the staircase is so steep that it’s almost a ladder but prospective tenants should really be told about this – anyone with a problem with stairs or a large and heavy suitcase might find it almost impossible to manage.  Even worse, it is really dirty, with a very badly worn carpet.  The bathroom is tiny.  The shower is just about big enough and the water pressure is adequate, but the rest of the space is very cramped indeed with a tiny basin which drained so slowly that we had to use the kitchen sink instead.  Either the room wasn’t cleaned, or it was and the problem was ignored – it would not be possible to clean without noticing it.  The toilet is separate, which is useful, but is also hardly bigger than a cupboard.   In the bedroom there are lights by the bed which are powered from an extension lead which is plugged into a wall socket which has no connection at all to the electrical circuit, so the only light in the room is a centre light switched from the door.  There is a balcony but it’s tiny and has no seats so it’s really only useful to stand and have a cigarette.  There is a large building at the back which is undergoing renovation and very noisy works can start quite early in the morning.  These problems are a great pity because they reduce what could be a 4 or 5 star apartment to only 3, in my opinion, and some of them could be sorted out quite easily.  Oh – and at well over €200/night it’s very expensive.  Two years ago I stayed at another Airbnb place two streets away which had two large bedrooms and cost 25% less.  After staying here I moved to an Airbnb apartment in the centre of Paris – hardly a cheap destination – and it was better in every respect and cost less. "
-1,"We found Christina to be a lovely person but were disappointed with the cleanliness of the flat.  It wasn't just one area, it was the kitchen, bathroom and the bedroom.  The floors were all filthy and the bedding smelt.  The kitchen work surfaces and sink were awful.  We understand that the cleaner wasn't available but that doesn't excuse the level of uncleanliness we experienced.  During our stay we contemplated moving out but there was not much availability due to the exhibition that was on.  We liked the cat, and that didn't cause any problem for us. However, we loved the location."
1,"Very enjoyable experience. Great stay with three lovely cats. Spacious apartment. Clean and tidy. 
Can arrive amsterdam centrum within 20mins by metro. Convenient."
0,"Maria's apartment was somewhat as described. It was in a good location and very easy to get into the city center. However, the bathroom was awful. The shower does not drain properly, which makes it impossible to take a shower without stopping to use the squeegee to push the water into the drain or just letting it flood. Also, the basin is in an odd location so you either have stand in the shower to brush your teeth or lean in. Because of that, I would not recommend this place if personal hygiene is important to you. "
1,The apartment was immaculate and very well decorated. Made us feel like home. It is located in the residential area with local amenities really close by.  The tram station is nearby and has direct links to the city centre. Highly recommend it!
-1,"The apartment was nice, however there was a horrible smell throughout, the cutlery drawer was mouldy and dirty, there was a dirty drying up towel in the kitchen, plus I think a cat lives there as there is a cat flap in the kitchen door and there was hair in the property. Had we known this before we booked, which there was no information about, we wouldn't have booked it as my partner is allergic to most animals (especially cats!).
Brilliant location but the apartment itself let our stay down. Not only did we have to pay a cleaning fee (the apartment wasn't even clean!) we had to pay a few other fees which made it a lot, lot more than it is worth."
1,"I recommend!
"
1,"Andrea is a wonderful host, very welcoming, very helpful about giving any information you might need. There are small goodies in the room, nice to find when you are tired from travelling, and she made us a delicious watermelon salad for dinner. The room is nice and spaceous, and tastefully decorated.
The neigbourhood provides you with good shopping facilities and the metro is only a very short walk away, so you can get to the center of Amsterdam easily. All in all we had a really lovely stay!"
-1,"Very upset waiting to check in,, 6 hours wanting outside ,,,
My day is wasted waiting ,, 
I arrived at the place on 13:30 pm , His friend came to take me on 19:30pm ,,, I was tired of traveling and wished I could get a better reception . When we arrived the flat and her chest was not cleaned , The person who took me cleaned it for half an hour ... It was a bad experience (I would not recommend it as a place to stay)"
1,"Nice flat, good location "
-1,"Ruslan was very nice and the flat was is a good location. Unfortunately we had a poor stay as we found bed bugs at 1am and had to move all our stuff out of the room and sit on the couch until morning. We were flying home the next day 40+ hours and spent our last day in Amsterdam at the laundry cleaning all our belongs. Flying home with bug bed bits and the stress was terrible. Ruslan seems like a nice person, I hope he sorted this and understands how serious bed bugs can be as he didn't seem to realise the seriousness of this. "
1,"Barak is a kind person received us very well, giving us various tips about the city. The apartment is exactly like the photos. Well equipped and located in a quiet street. Just is not recommended for people with physical limitations because there is no elevator and is on the third floor."
-1,"Do not stay here. It is very unclean and not sanitary. I wish we would have left but we had already paid €500 to stay here and I was afraid we would not find somewhere else on such late notice. The pillows they gave us to sleep on were their old used pillows which had probably been used for 20
Years. They stank awfully and were terribly stained.  They were literally yellow and brown. There was mold and mildew all over the kitchen and bathroom. The couch to sit on is stained and dirty. The kitchen towel
They gave us to Clean our dishes was dirty and bloody. I left in tears and went home and washed everything I brought with me. I felt sick. 

Also, it is not a private apartment as advertised. It is their garage, and they live there too. They woke us up coming in late and night and leaving early in the morning. We had paid extra for a private flat and this was absolutely not private. Also they had a cat that climbed on all our things- I alerted the owner I was allergic. No cat had ever been mentioned in the description. Please do not stay here. I wouldn't let my dog stay in these conditions. "
1,"Lovely room in a good, accessible location. Julie is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Highly recommended!"
1,"Great little place, perfect location & distance to everything. Very quiet & clean house. Liz is very friendly & helpfool! "
1,"Judit was a very friendly host and always answers your queries within a few hours. The flat had everything that one needs and situated in a quiet area. If given a refurbishment, especially bathroom, it would be more welcoming. Bus stop is only 5mins away and even a big shopping comlplex. Great stay. Thanks a lot judit."
-1,The host was available by message and fast to answer. The room was dirty of dust and the bedsheet smelled very awful. The shower need renovation. The toilet was very little. Not a king-size bed. Only two mattress joined together. A gap between them in the night during the sleep.
1,"We enjoyed our stay at the Studio Apartment. Jan greeted us when we arrived and it was easy to get to with the directions from the Centraal station. The courtyard where you access the apartment has two entries both on adjacent streets so you can't really get lost. The weather was perfect for our stay. Jan gave us some tips on where to eat and local markets. It was a short walk into the centre and close to supermarkets, bakeries, restaurants and bike hire. It was a safe area at nighttime. There is a kids dance studio a couple doors down however they aren't very noisy. "
1,"Great place, great host, amazing location!! "
1,Eli is a very friendly host. The apartment is very nice and you are very fast in the centre of amsterdam. I can recommend this apartment!
-1,"We had a horrible experience in the apartment. A moulded banana in the fridge on arrival was a good indicator that this flat hadn't been checked or cleaned in a while. Hardly any light switches worked meaning we cooked in the dark, there is a mound of bird dirt out the bedroom window to mention a few things. To top it all off there we bed bugs infested in the bed and room meaning we slept on the sofa then left first thing in the morning but found we couldn't get another apartment. Terrible start to a holiday and overall bad experience. "
1,Emil was a very nice host. He came to pick us at the station and was always there to help us. The room is very clean and comfortable. The access to the center is very easy and fast. We recommend.
1,"Andrea was very welcoming and friendly.
The room was clean, bright and comfortable.  Much information was provided on activities in Amsterdam.  The locality was lovely.  Andrea, as a host surpassed her job with her hospitality.  I would really recommend her place."
-1,"This is was a very bad experience for a number of reasons.  I would never , ever recommend that anyone stay here."
-1,"We had an awful experience here.  First, you should know that this is not owned and operated by a person, but instead an organization.  We ended up interacting with 7 different people.  Here's what happened:
1) They charged us 20 Euros for a late check in and we were taken to the wrong apartment.  There are two very similar apartments next to each other, but the other one has a nicer bathroom, but no couch and is much louder.  Also, it is against AirBnB's guidelines to have this extra fee.
2) It took an entire day of communicating just to move us one apartment over, to the one that was listed, which included tons of frustrating communication, across 4 different people who repeatedly ignored information in my messages.
3) The bathroom smells awful.  It is like the shower drain is connected to the sewer pipe.  Also, the bathroom is tiny and the shower is on top of the toilet, basically.
4) The toilet operates in a pretty gross way.  I think, due to where the sewer line was, they had to switch where the ""bowl"" part of the toilet is, which means the drain is in the front and not the back, so there is just a shelf of porcelain underneath you.  Think about that.
5) The WiFi services both of the apartments and is extremely intermittent.  I was unable to do my work very well there as I was disconnected every few minutes.
6) Even with all these issues, they were unwilling to refund the 20 Euros, which apparently, they should not have charged in the first place.

I submitted a claim to AirBnB, and they refunded me two of the nights as I had requested, apologized for everything that happened, and said they would be contacting the host to address the behavior and issues that we experienced."
0,"Excellent location, spacious apartment, old building with VERY steep and narrow stairs to 3rd floor.  No sink in bathroom, no stove or washing machine.  Balcony door does not lock and large ladder just beyond balcony.  Missing little touches like dish washing liquid, matches, paper towels, etc.  Not a bad experience, but expected more based on price, photos and general airbnb experience."
-1,"Hi Sammy, 

I wish I had better news for the review board but I have to be honest. Our stay was not enjoyable. We arrived at 1:00 to meet to find a family still occupying the flat. We agreed to meet back at the flat at 3:00. No evidence that a cleaning service would be arriving, hence the 35 Euro cleaning fee. Found dirty dishes in dishwasher, flat left as if things were just tucked into places in a hurry, whole flat needed a good cleaning. I would not recommend this flat. I suggest you tidy up and get a good cleaning then it would be suitable to advertise you flat. 
Monique "
1,A charming appartment well served by public transportation (tram 1 and 17). Many thanks to Andrea for the reception.
0,"Yury seemed to be a lovely person & accomodating host. The apartment is tired around the edges needing some work but it's a good size & did the job. The place was clean overall but the shower room drain smelt really bad. The linen & towels smelt of smoke which wasn't great as it's suppose to be non-smoking. Also I woke up with awful allergies which I could only put down to there possibly being a cat (just a warning). The kitchen was a nice space but it would have been lovely to have used the balcony. Noise was an issue when we were there, the annoying thing about this was Yury asked us to be quiet & respectful which wasn't a problem, but it was frustrating when the neighbours were blaring music & renovation work was going on below. Not Yury's fault obviously but might want to keep this in mind if travelling with kids. "
-1,"Its was really a bad experience!
Not a real home, just a dormitory, plus, they dont even clean the bath room, and the room. Before we arrived, I tried to call the host thound times, and no one answer. And the front desk staffs also had a bad attitude. 
This is the most worst experience, I strongly inform everyone that dont thinking to stay here."
1,"Judit has a nice apt 
It was a nice weekend in Amsterdam
The apt is a bit far from the city central in relative to the whole city which is really small :)
But for us getting to the center in 20 mins wasn't a big deal ;) for that amount of money
The apt is perfect in all other aspects 
Judit was very helpful
Hope you will enjoy ur stay here
And we definitely gonna be back again :)"
1,"We stayed at Vicky's apartment 6-9th Feb 2015. She responded promptly to all our enquiries both before and after our visit. The directions from the train station were good and it was easy to find and was only a 5 min walk, if you don't take any wrong turns like us. On arriving, although Vicky was on holiday, her friend Agnes met us there and was friendly and very welcoming and was able to answer all our questions and give useful advice about sightseeing and places to eat. There was also a bottle of Prosecco, some chocolates and fresh flowers to greet us which was a nice touch. 

The location was great and we were able to walk everywhere from the apartment. The apartment itself was excellent and very clean with everything you might want for a relaxing evening in after a long day walking round the city. The TV had plenty of channels in English (dutch subtitles) Although BBC channels didn't have good reception there were plenty of others to chose from.  The kitchen and bathroom were fully equipped and well stocked with cleaning equipment, toiletries and some basic condiments of cooking. The apartment was also very clean. 

There is a flea market and flower market within easy walking distance but we found the both a little disappointing. The flea market was not worth the walk. The flower market, although things were well priced, was not as good as the tourist guides would have you believe but still worth a look.  If you like cheese you will be spoilt for choice with plenty of shops to choose from.

There aren't many places we've visited where you feel more in danger of being run over by a bike rather than a car. This is not a criticism just an observation. Be sure to look  both ways whenever you cross a road as you can't hear the bikes coming. With the high proportion of residents using bikes for transport we found the city and our location very quiet especially when we compare it to London (chalk and cheese, no pun intended, well maybe a small one)

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely come again and have no hesitation in recommending Vicky's apartment to if you want a comfortable and upmarket apartment for a very reasonable price."
1,"Had a fantastic time here, Conny was so amenable with everything, and only a phone call away if you have an awful sense of direction.
The place itself is beautiful and within a few minutes walking of everywhere! I would love to stay here again, and hopefully will be doing so soon! Thank you Conny!!!"
1,Lara was AMAZING host and the apartment was in a great location. Everything was within walking distance.
1,"Very nice place! We past an exellent stay the flat is spacy and cosy, the neibourhood is quiet and awfull. We had a warm welcoming from Ilva Maria. "
-1,"I will be brief: I had never had such a poor Airbnb experience.
To the third party handling this flat (yes, there is a sub-company other than Airbnb or the host herlself handling the place) what on Earth are you thinking ?
For starters, the check in: Arrived early morning to Amsterdam, to have the (fake) host profile tell me I could not check in before 14h00 since there were other guests leaving the place. I agreed kindly; this happens, you go with it. Once we arrived to the flat, her (fake) friend came over to give us the keys. This was a guy who worked for a company that rents flats on Airbnb, and once I told him I did not sign up for any third-party deal, he continued by replying that it was clearly marked on the flat's profile and that it was normal (which is not, and neither is it marked anywhere in any profile that once you rent this flat you are doing it through a second company and not directly with the owner of the place). Bref, the guy gave us no indications or tips about the flat whatsoever —nor did he have the wifi and passwords, we had to wait for an hour for the company to give us the codes—and promptly left after telling us that the Sunday check out ought to take place by 11am. My train leaving at 20h00, he continued by stating that otherwise there would be incurring fees. Thank you, so kind of you. Also, this gentlemen told us that we were the first guests staying ever at the flat, so the (fake) host profile lied to us when she said there were people before us and could not check-in early in the morning.
About the flat: ok place. Everything is fake and cheaply renovated, carving and wood pieces done in polystyrene. Walking around the place meant the whole thing was shaking and the floor is uneven, meaning we put a ball by the window that naturally rolled over to the other side of the room do to the uneven floor. Horribly uncomfortable bed; the bed is a two piece mattress as opposed to one twin bed as indicated on the flat's profile. The bathroom is in good condition, other than the messy Italian shower that, without ANY floor matt making of each shower taken a universal flood in the bathroom floor.  

This is the worst stay I have ever had on Airbnb, a place where human-to-human interaction is essential in order to take care of people's homes. Instead this scam and its people provided little to no help and made the whole situation awfully bureaucratic and annoying. 

WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE NO ANYONE. DONT STAY WITH THESE PEOPLE; ITS ALL A SCAM. If I could I would take my money back. "
1,"Louise is very friendly and I recommend this place because it's clean, convenient and safe."
1,"A great little apartment for a few days in Amsterdam. Despite awful weather we received a lovely warm welcome when we arrive at the apartment with lots of info and a cup of tea.
The apartment is in a great spot with nearby restaurants and breakfast spots and the easy to work out tram system has a tram stop on the doorstep so the travel to city sites is easy.
The accommodation is fabulous with comfortable beds, a fabulous shower and all amenities,
Perfect!"
1,Gorgeous apt and superhosts (Elmar and his brother Arno)...We cant ask more!! We had a very bad experience before and Elmar Quickly answered to our request and allowed us to do an immediately check in... Thks again!!
0,"Spacious apartment located next to tram line and Vondelpark, with washer and drier. The host allowed us to drop our bags early which was much appreciated as we were traveling with an infant. Some very basic things would make this place much nicer to stay in and more worth the $350 per night we ended up paying. These include hand soap in the bathroom, more than 2 full size towels, even one washcloth, not having to rewash bedding that had stains on it upon arrival, having the couch steam cleaned as it is pretty grimy, and a cutting board with knives that actually cut things in the kitchen. I would have also appreciated not having to wash a dish washer full of awful smelling dishes or tossing out rotting produce and other food items upon arrival. We also got basically no check in or check out instructions. Finally, this place does have a cute little balcony as pictured, but no place to sit and enjoy it, which was part of the appeal to us. Overall , for a 2 bedroom apartment in a fairly expensive city, this was a good find, just would have been more comfortable if it felt more clean."
1,"We stayed with Ann and Peter for three nights - their home is even more charming in person! The location is extremely convenient - it's a couple-minute walk from the train station, making it super convenient to get to/from the airport. Everything was spotlessly clean and prepared for us upon arrival - even homemade cookies and stroopwafels stacked within a jar in our bedroom. On the first evening, Ann and Peter welcomed us with a hot cup of tea and stroopwafels, which was wonderful after the cold. Their apartment has a wonderful feeling of being homey and comfortable. We adored the cozy downstairs bedroom (""the nap room"") with the bed nestled in between the walls that Peter built with his own hands, the books lining the shelves (albeit mostly unreadable to us since many were in Dutch), a vaseful of tulips, and the canal view outside. There's a heater in the room, too. Even the bathroom is beautiful and spacious. We also enjoyed the excitable Hooper and hearing his paws scamper across the floorboards every morning, eager to greet us and beg at the table in hopes of food. Ann's airbnb-famous breakfasts - consisting of orange juice, coffee, yogurt, bits of salami, warm and crisp croissants, freshly baked quiches, extravagant fruit bowls - were among our favorite meals in Europe - they were that delicious! Ann was even thoughtful enough to ask beforehand about dietary preferences and restrictions/allergies. Really appreciate all the thought and effort Ann put into making our stay comfortable! Ann's open and warm personality immediately made us feel very welcome - it was great hearing about her insights on Amsterdam and traveling. We did not happen to see Peter very much but he was very nice to speak with as well. They're very kind people, and it was a little sad for us to leave, but we were definitely glad to have come!"
1,My partner and I left our accommodation booking for Amsterdam till very last minute after so many apartments falling through so this apartment wasn't as central to Amsterdam as we'd hoped but was still very easy to reach every location we needed. The apartment was clean and bright and we loved the decorative touches. Whilst we weren't huge fans of the neighbourhood it definitely didn't effect us too much as we spent most of the time off doing other things anyway and it wasn't awful or anything :). There are multiple shops nearby including a night shop for all your needs and the tram is literally a two minute walk away. The building is lovely and modern and Olga was happy to help us out with anything we needed.   If you're looking for somewhere a little bit away from all the crowds of the city then this is a great place to stay and Olga was a great host :)
1,"Carolina is very friendly; the room is well located not far away from the center of Amsterdam (about 15 minutes max.), the bed is comfortable.
Perfect :)"
1,"the apartment is perfectly nice. the bed is a little stiff and the STAIRS are a REAL DEAL THING hahaha be prepared! but there are cats who hang out in the staircase who are very nice. and miriam had such a thoughtful welcome packet, which was helpful. we LOVED the neighborhood. far from the over-touristy awfulness. lots of local spots in the neighborhood which was really cool!"
1,"Staying with Iosif was really nice! Unfortunately we didn't see him that much (we stayed just one weekend in Amsterdam) but he is a very good host! I was so happy to have the chance to sleep there in last minute! We really felt comfortable and the bathroom/bedroom/kitchen is clean. If you need something, he will help you with pleasure. Thank you for everything!"
1,"I had a great time at Judit's place. The apartment is located in the north part of the city, and a short bus ride takes you directly in the city center. The apartment covers all your needs: nice kitchen, fast Internet connection and a comfortable bed to crash after a long day in the city. Judit is a very reliable host, and she always tries to help you if you have a problem. Totally recommended! "
1,The flat is located near a tram station and it is very convenient. Tessa is a nice girl. 
1,"Judit was an outstanding host and we truly appreciated her concurrent feedback as we got closer and closer. She was very welcoming and polite.  The apartment was a 15-20min bus ride to downtown, but very manageable."
1,"The apartment was extremely easy to find and in a very nice neighborhood just on the outskirts of all the chaos and noise but still close to everything you desire. On that note if you are not used to walking regularly I would suggest hiring a bike from either Morgan/Lisa or the many bike rentals scattered across town. 

We were pleasantly greeted by Lisa upon arrival and the overwhelming sigh of relief of an elevator :D. Entering the apartment you will immediately find that the space is 100 times better in person and filled with all the amenities necessary and a more than you could ask for welcoming basket filled with goodies. Wifi Speed is good and loads of good channels on the well sized TV. The apartment itself is spotless and THAT BED IS TOOOOO COMFY! wasted half my holiday vegtablised in that beauty. 

*IMPORTANT*
Lisa is an absolute LEGEND!. I arrived only to find that I had forgotten my asthma inhaler at home and within 2 hours she had arranged for me to pick one up from the local pharmacy. Love you long time Lisa :). If you have a medical condition, before traveling make sure you either take ample supply of your medication or get a prescription arranged online as a lot of medication there is not readily available over the counter as in a lot of other countries. 

Literally a stones throw away is a SPAR supermarket and a restaurant/bar just below the building. I would strongly suggest stocking up on essentials, Eggs, bread, beverages etc as if you get peckish after 9-10 pm the majority of things are shut. Ordering food online is what we did on occasions and never had bad experiences (pizza is always a safe bet :P) 

To summarize, beautiful apartment, good location(bike recommended), great hosts and an amazing holiday. If you havent booked to stay at Morgans place for your amsterdam trip I really dont know what your doing with your life :P

Cheers Morgan and Lisa DANKJEWEL!"
1,"Great nights on the patio deck overlooking the Amstel, close to cafes, grocery stores and public transit. "
0,"The entrance of the building is really awful, completely dirty and with two narrow stairs with little light to illuminate the way.
The place has old furniture and the first impression is that everything is dirty on the house because of the old stuff. Sadly, expectations did not match up with reality.
The wooden floor makes noise, the old couch smells bad, curtains were dirty and old and a lot of items in the kitchen drawers were dirty.
The bathroom does not have a simple toilet paper hanger, a toilet bin, a towel holder.
The shower is good, but the curtain is dirty and used, awful. The shower floor is dark, terrible.
A thumbs up to the host, extremely attentive and available to help us anytime during our stay."
1,"Best home with best location in the best neighborhood of Amsterdam, Anna Sophie was the perfect host...recommend for other future guests. Definitely would love to stay there again! 

Thanks very much Anna Sophie. "
1,"Chris’ apartment was great! Very clean, comfortable, and in a perfect location. Be sure to check out the chocolate store across the street (top 10 in the world!). Would certainly recommend and stay again! Thanks for having us, Chris!"
1,"Very nice house, we were 5 people and it fit us comfortably. Eventhough its not in the center its location is nice and easy to get to wherever you want to go ."
-1,"Host is a scammer! Beware, I had the absolute WORST experience with Chris. His behavior was shameful and disgusting.

I booked his room for 1 night in Amsterdam and communicated very clearly in messages that I would arrive late, 9:30pm or later.

I never received any response from him but it should have been OK because his instructions clearly stated that he would leave keys to the apartment in a lockbox outside and that we simply had to unlock it to access our keys. 

My flight was delayed so I arrived in Amsterdam around midnight. Again, this was communicated with Chris via the app but he never responded. 

I finally show up to the apartment late and exhausted and lugging my baggage, open the box (Website hidden by Airbnb) keys! I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt and called him several times and left a message. He didn’t respond to my phone calls but quickly texted me saying “what’s up, can’t talk right now” 

I explained that the keys were missing and we couldn’t get in and his response was essentially “sorry, tough luck. I’m not in the city and can’t help, contact air bnb and see what they can do. The keys aren’t available at midnight” This response was OUTRAGEOUS! Not what he advertised at all as he said we could access the room whenever due to the keys being in the lockbox.

He didn’t seem surprised that the keys weren’t there as he said, so I feel like he knew we couldn’t get in that day, and he literally could not care less that I was stranded in Amsterdam with suitcases and nowhere to go/stay. 

I had to wander the city until 2am and finally found a hotel, having to pay $100+ out of pocket to sleep for 6 hours before checking out.

I was appalled and disgusted by the lack of basic decency and respect that Chris showed me, and to this day I haven’t received any response from him or apology. I had to fight with air bnb to give me a refund because he literally did not give me access to the apartment. 

He is a scammer and a terrible person and you would be wise to stay far away from this individual who will leave you stranded and not give the slightest damn about it. Awful, shameful and disgusting. I would give negative stars if i could."
1,"I cannot recommend Humberto's studio in Amsterdam enough! It was in the perfect location, a beautiful place to stay and Humberto went above and beyond as a host. After an awful traveling experience Humberto's hospitality really saved my holiday!"
1,"Well, it was a great place to stay. A good space and clean.
The girl who received us was very helpful and Judit always answered our questions (whatsapp) quickly.
I really loved the place."
1,"Safe and great location, i do not like to share my room but it was not bad experience anyway"
-1,"It was ours worst experience at this Airbnb property, i hope no one gets a nightmare like what we got during our stay, bathroom lock not working, room handle as well as lock broken, towels were all smelly, no new soap or shower gel given, all were used and kept like that, in short nothing was good about the property nor location, really very bad experience. Host was never there to attend us instead there was some caretaker named Harry whose behavior was really bad and very unresponsive. we waited for an hour on the road after he asked for a grace time for 4pm, he came at 5pm. Sorry but this place is highly not recommendable.
"
1,"Clean home, not luxury but confortable, clean room, perfect bed (and my husband is xxxl...), bathroom very confortable and clean, kitchen very clean and usefull, very good breakfast, Astrid is simply perfect, friendly and full of attentions. The home is outside the center of the city, 8 minutes of walk and15 minutes of metro (C53) and  this is a minus for who want come out of home and find immediately the movida, but perfect for who, after a day of walking-shopping-seeing- between billion of people want relax and listen only byrds twhistl... and all this at a very, very good price... thanks Astrid, we will see again!
"
1,"Although I didn't get to meet Xiong (he was away on business) he communicated very well and I always felt up to date with what I needed to know. Reina (who is one of Xiong's neighbours) gave me the key and showed/explained everything to me very clearly. The place was very clean, the bed was comfortable and I slept well. Location for me (because I was with my car) was also very good and only 15mins into the centre. The ONLY thing I could say is that I appreciate completely that through Airbnb it is not a hotel and that you should treat it as if you would expect someone to treat your house. Having said that, by using Airbnb the prices are often similar to hotel rates so it's also your choice to do it to make an income, so there needs to be a bit of a balance. I feel Xiong was perhaps a bit too tight with some rules (perhaps has had bad experiences in the past) particularly with the usage of an iron/ironing board. Anyone travelling for business will need to neaten their clothes and to say, it's my house not a hotel, how many homes do not have an iron/ironing board? Anyway, that is the only negative so if you are just looking for a quiet, clean place to relax and visit Amsterdam, especially if you are with the car, I can fully recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks for a great stay!"
-1,"Bad experience in general. The host changed our reservation and gave us another room, "" the pink room"". It was a smaller room than the one we had booked. We weren't allowed to use the kitchen even though the new room was in the same apartment and was  specifyed in the publication. She didn't even let us heat aater for a tea. The pink room had a sofa cama, not a bed, and the room was  small. The location was far away the city center and the price was cheap comparing to other places."
-1,"Sammy's flat is well located but we had a bad experience regarding the organisation. Communication was really difficult, no clear answer, long time without news which was really unconfortable for our organisation mainly for a business trip.
"
1,"Carolina and Nnanna were nothing but incredible hosts and are instantly the loveliest and coolest people. Every need we had was met, they gave us privacy but also checked up on us to see if everything was okay. The room itself was perfect, there were maps and snacks waiting for us on arrival and Carolina also offered for us to use her tea and oven etc. whenever we needed, which was super nice of her. The location is about 15/20 mins from central Amsterdam but this was nothing but a bonus, getting to see the not so touristy side of the place was great, and the busses are very efficient, you can buy a pass for however long you're in Amsterdam which entitles you to GVB (the main operator of travel) Buses and Trams which is insanely good value for money. There were also delays to most flights the day of our departure and Nnanna made sure we were aware which totally saved us being late to the airport. All in all, they were absolutely amazing hosts. Incredible value for money with much more of a relaxing experience, i would wholeheartedly recommend this listing more than anywhere else!"
1,Great location to explore Amsterdam from. We hope to be back some day!
-1,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She treated our private apartment bathroom as a public bathroom (!!!) and charged €1 for the code for the code into our apartment for our bathroom. We woke up from a nap to a stranger walking in looking to pee. I’m scared by how many possibly came into our place while we weren’t home, obviously our valuables were unlocked and scattered about.  

Before we even got there, she told us the apartment we reserved was no longer available when we were 72 hours from check in because it had “lit on fire a while ago”, yet waited to tell us until the last minute. She forced us into a different studio due to the short time frame. Terrible communicator; we were unsure where our new studio was located, how many beds it had, or any other basic details 24 hours before check in. She would only respond once or twice a day, even while she was changing the accommodations and rules under our feet. Consistently felt like she was trying to scam us."
-1,"Place looked great at first glance. The beds were not made when we arrived but I contacted the host and I was asked if I wanted to make the beds or have someone sent. Well I paid over $1100 for only 5 days so yeah I wanted them to make the beds. Someone came an hour later and made them. Main bed is way too firm, hard to sleep on. Our first morning waking up there was at 6am to heavy construction above us. I'm talking LOUD ear piercing drills! I spoke with the construction workers and they said they were going to be working there everyday of our stay. From about 7am to 4pm was a nightmare to be in that apartment with all the noise. So much for relaxing. There was food debries in sink, daddy long leg spiders and pincher bugs in the tub/shower room, dust under sofa, and not enough thick blankets to fight the cold when the heater wasnt warm enough. Only had a closet full of thin sheets. I contacted host to ask to be moved to different apartment but of course nothing else was availible. They said the only other thing they could offer us was a partial refund of $150. Was not happy with this offer but airbnb says they cant do anything about noise. So had to suck it up, take the $150 (i had to initiate refund), and be on a curfew of going to bed early, wake up to helish noise, and leave the apt all day not to return until all the noise stopped. Pretty awful to rent a place knowing construction is happening. Feel bad for the next guests who have to stay during this remodel."
1,"Sammy was a good accommodating host who communicated well with both me and my friends throughout our stay. 

The apartment is accurately described and really is in a great location for exploring Amsterdam. I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Amsterdam and will be staying with Sammy again. "
1,Andrea was an excellent host and the room was spacious and spotless. She had organized everything to make for an enjoyable and stress free visit. She was very considerate and gave us our space but was easy to contact if we needed anything. Would highly recommend staying with Andrea.
1,The location is excellent and the apartment is comfortable with all amenities as described. We really enjoyed our 4 days in Amsterdam. Thank you Annemeike.
0,"PROS: 
- Great location. 5 min bike ride or 10 min walk to museumplein.
- Big, warm comfy bed.
- Neighborhood is charming at night.
- Breakfast is yummy, served from 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM.
- Jan himself is a very nice guy. He seems to work from home, so you may see that his colleagues often visit his office room on the second floor.

CONS:
- Pictures fail to convey that the house is very, very old and a little creepy/dimly lit at night.
- There were often unpleasant smells emanating from some place and sometimes the bathroom on 2nd floor.
- Towels provided smelled like they weren't properly dried.
- Bathrooms on our floor (2nd) were very old. Shower room on 3rd floor was nice/renovated but inconvenient to have to walk up a steep flight of stairs to get there.

Overall, not a bad experience if you have a short stay. But for 5 days, I would recommend elsewhere."
1,"We loved our stay at Lettie’s. The apartment is bright, spacious and stylish - plenty of space for two adults and two teenagers. It was lovely being in a quiet, calm part of Amsterdam (easy to get to via tram 19 - note this as the tram routes have changed recently).

We really recommend the boat trip with Jurriaan (the highlight of our stay). He was fantastic with our two teenagers who loved steering. And we enjoyed the bike hire too. All in all it was a fantastic break. Thank you Lettie."
-1,If you are 50 years old or over and are trying to go to Amsterdam to have a very relaxing time then Denise's place will be great for you. If you are a bit younger looking to have fun in Amsterdam and enjoy your place then I would not recommend. After we checked out of the place I was accused of multiple wrongdoings that occur in a normal living environment. I will leave it at that but like I said if you stay here be ready to be mislead. 
1,"The flat completly aligned to the offer which was decribed, so no bad experience. We had a great time there. thx

René"
1,"Apartment is exactly as pictured.  Clean, bright and in a magnificent location.  The 9 Streets is full of dining and shopping options and the neighborhood is quiet and lovely at night. 

The apartment is very clean, sheets are sparkling white and towels are in good condition (but a little rough).  I have high cleaning standards and I find that's usually my main issue with rentals and I don't have ANY complaints about the cleanliness of this apartment.  The apartment is in great shape! 

There is plenty of storage space  for your clothes (2 closets with some drawers) and a hamper for your dirty clothes which I always find very helpful in apartment rentals.  There is also a Washer AND Dryer. 

Yes, the stairs are awful but they are only a problem when you arrive and leave AND I think most buildings in Amsterdam have stairs so I think the issue is unavoidable in this city. 

Recommendations for owner:  a body length mirror would be very helpful. This is the first apartment I rent that doesn't have one. It was frustrating when getting ready that the only mirror is in the bathroom. There are some strong spices that smell like curry in the pantry and it made the living room have a very strong curry odor.  I moved them to the refrigerator while we were there. "
1,"losif and his friends are really nice and friendly people and to stay at their place was just perfect. it is a really good place to stay, not far from the city center and the breakfast was really deliciouss :) can highly recommend!"
1,"I have stayed at many airbnb locations and never had a bad experience, however Rinze has set the bar so high for now future airbnbs because he was such a gracious host! His houseboat was so stylish, clean and absolutely perfect location! I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended!"
-1,"When i arrived Peter ( a very graciuous friend of Wijntje ) let me into the place.

I did notnhave the wifi code so the friendnhas tomlet memuse his and when i asked Wijtje, i felt i had to justify the use of it,

The place has no working kitchen, ans the shower was broken i used the bat tub to ahower every day.  No towels, or soap was provided and the place always had allmyhe other doors locked and closed.  

I sent an email to Wijtje because i needed to wash my clothes, until today I have not gotten a response

I saw Wijntje for two minutes once the first day i got there

The room lacked a working lamp

I did not have a good experience as I have in the past i all my rb&b experiences  and the directions to the place were not correct 

I felt that i was not wanted and the basic polite manners were not used

For what I was charged it was not worth it and i would not recommend this place unless changes are made

If you are a female traveler I would  not recommend it because the walk to her place is dark and it does not feel safe

Thank you   

I hope this is used as a learning experience
"
-1,"The place was nice, but the host was a horrible man, really rude to say the least. We had a great time in the city, but the experience with this man was awful and left us with a really bad feeling overall. We are disappointed with him."
-1,"I had a terrible experience at David’s flat. There was no electricity during my stay, which means not hot water, heating or fridge to storage food. Another big issue was that David used a local service to manage the flat. They didn’t have any will to fix the situation or to reply to the messages. Very frustrating! Airbnb refunded 50%, the rest should come from the host. But the host doesn’t reply to my messages. Very bad experience!"
1,"Was a great stay. The house was very clean, the dogs were sweet and we enjoyed talking with Elsie and learning all about the area. She gave us an excellent restaurant recommendation and the train was a short (Website hidden by Airbnb) need for the bus in our opinion. Would recommend and stay again without a doubt!"
0,Slightly above average apartment in an extremely noisy social housing (?) block. The apartment was light and nicely furnished but the walls are so thin I could hear the neighbour upstairs adjusting the radiator nob! It was very difficult to sleep because of the noise - which was not excessive - but extremely disturbing. The pillows are also awful though the bed was ok.
1,"Andrea is a great host. She was waiting for us at the exact time we arranged and explained everything about the flat and the neighborhood upon arrival. Her place is spotless and the room is very big, bright and confortable with all the amenities included (bathrobes, towels, a small fridge, dishes, glasses and anything you need for a quick breakfast inside your room). The decoration of the room makes it very classy, modern and some how minimalistic (everything is black and grey). We loved it. It is just 4 min walking to the train station and bus stops, which can take you directly to the city in 15 min or 8 stops more or less. The flat is located in very safe neighbourhood outside the city center surrounded by condos inside a park where you can jog if you want every morning. Thanks for everything Andrea. Was great meeting you."
1,"It is simply amazing that Marty lets guests stay in her beautiful home. The location is perfect: out front are three restaurants, a bar, and a café with some of the best coffee I've ever had. Every-day shopping can be done in the immediate vicinity and you can reach the city centre in 15 minutes. And if you've had enough of all the tourists, Marty has a cozy balcony that shelters your from all the noise.
Marty herself is a wonderful host and a delightful person, very responsive and accommodating.
Highly recommended!"
1,"Edwin was a perfect host. I had awful flight issues and ended up arriving a day late, but he was ready and waiting for me when I arrived. He carried my bag up to the room (and back down at check out) which was great, cause the stairs are typical Dutch style, steep and tall! Lol. 

Others have noted it's a bit loud. Yes, I did hear noise, but nothing too crazy. Normal Europe noise on a busy street, but almost not traffic as Amsterdam is bike/walking friendly. I'm a light sleeper and had no trouble sleeping, with both windows open. 

His cat was so cute, and walked into my room whenever I opened my door, and acted like it was his room. But it a cat person, so might be biased, lol. 

Location was great, walking distance to almost everything you want to see. Very easy to take the train and tram from the airport to the house. There is a mini fridge, kettle, coffe/tea and cups you can use one floor door by the bathroom. 

I enjoyed everything about my stay. Thank you Edwin!"
1,"Beautiful home in a beautiful area, the garden area and the kitchen are two of the standout areas in this home along with such a easy check in and check out. The location is amazing, there is one tram that gets you straight to the centre in under 20 minutes and a supermarket less than 10 minutes walk away. I would recommend this home to anyone visiting Amsterdam at any time of the year! "
-1,"Bad experience. The guy who greeted us on Michiel's behalf told us to park our car in a place that was nos authorized and it was taken during the night by the police. Result : 393€ fine and a day wasted because of wrong information provided.
We tried to contact Michiel, he did not want to acknowledge  any part in this mess - said he would call us back  but he did not.

Not a reliable guy / company (in fact it is a company who rents apartments of other people, we guess they don't know the surroundings, that's why this happened)
We would definitely not recommend this host."
1,"The room is very nice and quiet as well as entire flat. It was very clean  and tidy, according to The pictures and price. I had to pay 2 euros to leave my bag.  The owner was very polite and helpful. The only bad experience for me was at my arrival from the airport as my flight was landing at 11pm and it was difficult to get to the house because there are a lot of buildings. The neighbourhood is dark and lonely at night so better arrive early. but I would recommend it for a quiet and cheap  stay."
-1,"I had very bad experience with Stefan ,I rented the room for 3 days the first day goes ok the second and the third day no electricity and no internet I stayed 2 days in the darkness I checked every thing to find the problem but it looks he didn't pay his bills and the company blocked the electricity . I called hem to send some one to  find and fix the problem but he told me he is out of the country and today it's to late but tomorrow for sure he will send some one to fix it ,I was waiting the second day but he didn't send any one he told me it's weekend and it's expensive to send engineer he is very good in playing game with others he gave me hope the first day and he knows he will not send any one , in the 2 days also I contacted hem by whatsapp messages told hem he must fix if not he should return back to my some money because he charges me 50 euro extra to stay in another room not the one in the web but he still playing game with me.also i will contact airbnb regarding this ."
0,"While Dennis and Chantal were excellent hosts and the apartment is beautiful and exactly as depicted, it is important Airbnb users are made aware of an incident we experienced during our stay.

On our second night we came home to discover that $6,000 (about 4000 Euro) worth of our valuables had been stolen, with no evidence of forced entry. Dennis and Chantal believe it may have been on account of previous guests not returning a set of keys, and watching the apartment till we left it unattended. 

This is, apparently, a known occurrence in Amsterdam, and with the apartment being at ground level, with the bedroom close to the front door, in a quiet location, it could be considered ideal for this sort of crime. 

While it was disappointing that the locks had not been changed after a set of keys went missing, especially as the previous guests did not provide an explanation, Dennis and Chantal were outstanding at helping us communicate with authorities. They also provided us with advice and support in this difficult time, and we thank them for that. 

The apartment is indeed in a beautiful neighbourhood, and was clean and well-maintained. On these grounds we would still recommend it as a place to stay, but would advise future guests to book with caution.  "
1,"After falling for an apartment scam and having nowhere to go when we arrived, we were extremely grateful to Fernanda and Roy for their quick responses and hospitality. It meant we were able to start enjoying our trip without any further stress. The apartment was perfect, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay and we would love to visit again sometime. Thank you very much :)"
1,"This is everything you could possibly want from an Air Bnb. The hosts were lovely and let us drop our bags off at 9am in the morning so we didn’t have to carry them around the city whilst we explored. They cleaned the whole place for us within the space of a few of hours as it was a last minute booking. They were so warm and welcoming! By 1pm we were able to head back from the centre and get some rest from our long day of travelling. This place has all the lovely little homey touches, blankets to snuggle up in, a hairdryer, several towels, the shower/wet room - was insane and extremely relaxing! The sofa is a bit on the firmer side but none the less very comfy. The kitchen is fully equipped! By this, I mean completely stocked with any utensils you could possibly need, they also have an espresso machine although we didn’t use it. 

The garden is lovely! Tom (host) stated that it was a mess and in progress at the moment - however it was really scenic, they have a little shed with a roof that hangs over a small decking area where 2 chairs and a table is located. They have some really lovely pebbles and a flower box laid out. 

The bed was super comfortable! They have a memory foam mattress just like mine at home! They have designed it so that the place utilises all the possible space in the best way! The owners wife has a gorgeous beauty room but I don’t believe you would have access to this! You are able to shut the blinds to this room though. The bathroom was flawless, I love that in Europe you have plug sockets in the bathroom for drying hair/doing makeup/styling hair etc. 
They also left behind some deodorant and moisturiser, hair bands and sunscreen etc incase we were in need of the little things!

There was the teeniest bit of dust underneath the very back of the bed (under the headboard) but this place was spotless! They own a couple of beautiful cats that were roaming everywhere whilst we popped in the morning - I’m slightly allergic (I start sneezing awfully around them) - during my entire stay even when we came back later that day I didn’t have an issue at all as they had cleaned the place so well! We didn’t find one hair!

The layout of this apartment is fantastic, they have used all the space brilliantly and really taken advantage of the natural light by installing large wood sliding glass doors that distinctly make this place look so chic! They separate the bedroom/living area and also the back garden.
There is also a skylight in the bedroom at the foot of the bed!

They also have their names above the red front door so you’re able to tell where you’re going! 

P.s - tip for tourists. If you are considering Uber as your mode of transport, please bare in mind this is a very narrow street and Uber’s are ready to collect you almost instantly (2/3 min average) so you will need to be ready to go otherwise you could cause a back up. 

You can honestly just see the artistic design and the flawless finish that these two have put in to redesiging and making that house a home!

We loved our stay in Amsterdam and when we come again - I definitely hope to stay here! :)"
-1,IT'S A TRAP!  DON'T STAY IN THIS PLACE. I payed for 2 person and Jose told me to check in at 12h30 .I was there but could not find the place...asked him to find the house cause the adress is different than he says. He stopped answering my messages but somehow I found the apartment.  He booked at the same time another guy that was in the house and he opened to me. Everything was a mess ..he didn't espect me to come. The guy called him in the phone and then I could talk to Jose that said to me to get out immediately  of the apartment cause I made a mistake. He was very rude and got mad knowing that I was in the apartment . He told me to cancel the reservation and then he will cancel the accomodation.  But I did not cause he got strict policy and I know that he will keep the money. So I called  airbnb to undone this awful situation.  This guy have strict policy  so he  says to you to check in and then go out until 15h so you can't find his apartment and loose you money. Total joke to airbnb. Don't trust him
-1,"The studio was well located for our needs and is close to the tram stop. It was also nice having the outdoor space with the canal at the end of the garden. Tina is a great host and did everything she could to make us comfortable and welcome. The flat was lovely and quiet and warm too. 
Unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable and significantly dips in the middle giving us joint pain. Also there is a lack of storage space so for any stay more than a night or 2 made it quite difficult. The studio also was superficially clean which was a big disappointment."
1,"Louise was very kind and accommodating to us, and her apartment was great! We had everything we needed and were very satisfied. "
1,"It was a nice, clean and comfortable room, as seen in the photographs. It was in a beautiful neighborhood and near public transport. Also, Kathuh and her family were really kind. We had a great experience so I would highly recommend Kathuh's place!"
1,"Excellent place to stay and everything was exactly as described. The location is very convenient and the bus service is really good. Carolina is a great host,  fast to answer, helping when needed and kind in every communication, very friendly and informative.  
Thanks Carolina :)"
1,Marty’s house is great. Everything was just perfect!
-1,"Rats at the apartment!! John has not been a very good host, given his attitude and manners when it comes to treating his guests and dealing with the incident that has occurred during our stay at his property. Two days before arriving(there were four of us) we contacted him to ask if it was possible to leave the luggage from two of us in the apartment, because they arrived earlier and the check in is at 3 pm. John told us that it was not possible. So we not only had to wait with the luggage, but also the check in did not take place until approximately 15:15 as the cleaner didn't finish the apartment on time. Once in the apartment we observed a series of anomalies of which John had not informed us, bearing in mind that he asked for a deposit in case of damages: The washing machine was in use bedding in it which we had to put in the dryer when it was finished. The light from the stairs leading to the bedroom floor wasn't working. The small bedroom shelf was off the wall and couldn't be used. The dishwasher had a broken tray and was difficult to use. John also did not provide any dishwasher tablets. On the dining table there was a tray with decorative objects, among them there was a broken glass bottle, that when the table moved the bottle fell apart. John's ad says: clean apartment, but it did not stand out for its cleanliness. The most serious issue was that we began to suspect that there were rodents in John's property on the second day of our stay. We immediately contacted John to inform him of our concerns. It was not until the third day that we were able to corroborate that there were rats in the apartment and by then we had eaten food that was contaminated, we now that due to holes in breads and varies other signs of rodent infestation. We installed an Ipad recording during the night and the next morning the filming showed the existence of at least one rat running around the apartment.. The video is in youtube (famous video hosting) named ""Rats in Amsterdam apartment"". We did not received a reply from John. It is the first time we have had a bad experience with a host. John's attitude and ways of dealing with this incident left a lot to be desired. We have not felt well treated by him, given the seriousness of the matter. We have pictures of the food eaten by the rat, of which we were eating because we did not know at that point that the rats existed. It seems that John was not very concerned about what has happened. It took three days for him to respond and even then he did not give us a solution to the problem. Guests and owners have to be honest and truthful in their evaluations and we always have been. This..."
1,"My boyfriend and I, French students, went to Amsterdam during few days in Jennie’s apartment.
It was so pleasant to live in her accommodation: it is situated in a nice typical neighborhood of Amsterdam, near the main tramline and next to shops and Albert Heijn supermarket.
Her apartment is so cosy and clean like the photos we can see on Airbnb website, it looks like exactly the same! Even if the apartment is located near shops (2 minutes walking), the neighborhood isn’t noisy at all because there are a lot of accommodations there.
As for the apartment, we didn’t have any problem at all. We were welcomed by a Jennie’s friend, Veerle: she was very nice and we could contact her if we had any question during our stay, about the accommodation or even about the city. She was very friendly and gave us information and a welcome gift!!
For the check-out we could meet Jennie and her boyfriend, also very nice people and they are very friendly too.
We are totally pleased to have lived in this apartment for our holidays in Amsterdam.
I totally recommend this accommodation! :)"
1,"Anouk is such a great host. My friend & I stayed in her other room at the beginning of our trip & had such a great experience. This room was just as great. 
Anouk is so welcoming & has lots of suggestions for things to do around the area & beyond. She is always available for questions. Great host. I highly recommend this place!"
