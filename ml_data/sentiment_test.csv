-1,"Access efficient. Great area. House disappointing for several reasons.
Comfy bed but more and newer pillows and a new quilt needed
House smells of damp
Front door lock needs repairing
No dining table
2nd bedside table needed with lamp controlled from the bed.
Tv not working and wiring a mess.
This is a business not a personal flat. 
Loved the area and the city is brilliant. We paid too much for the rental though."
-1,"The apartment was very quick and easy to find via the tram from Amsterdam Centraal Station. It is in a lovely neighborhood and very close to the Anne Frank Huis.  Martijn's instructions for getting into the apartment were quite easy as well. The stairs are pretty steep as others have said but we managed to get our luggage up to the apartment. The apartment is as pictured and the balcony is very nice to enjoy the views from. However, the apartment is showing signs of wear and tear (i.e. torn chair, need for paint/touch-ups) and could also benefit from a good cleaning. With the exception of the wonderful balcony and the perfect location, I was slightly disappointed with the apartment overall. "
-1,"The studio is in a great location, and is a nice space. However, I was very dissatisfied with the amount of noise and activity in the building. It was very far from ""blissful"", as the neighbors were doing a major remodel upstairs and the noise was awful. The front door was wide open with lots of junk in the hallway, people up and down the steps all day, and the noise started at 7am!!! When I notified the ""owner"" (rental agency) of my displeasure, he said it was beyond his control. That was an unfortunate....I thought they could've done more to make the situation better. I would not stay there again."
1,Overall nice stay without any bad experience. Well located and access to the tram 26 within a couple of minutes.
1,"It was lovely to stay at Sven's. Due to our last minute booking, Sven was away but he made sure that his friend liaises with us and greeted us personally. His friend was very quick to respond to our needs.  We had a late departure for our flight back but his friend was very thoughtful and allowed us to drop off our luggages at her place as Sven is away. She was very flexible with the baggage drop&pick up time as well. The studio itself is as what you can see in the photos. The studio is clean and has everything you need including a microwave and a small fridge. The location is very close to the Albert de Cyup Market and there are so many great cafes and restaurants nearby within walking distance. I would say the location was the bomb. There is a metro station roughly 8 mins away by feet and the tram is just around the corner. We used the train from Schiphol airport and then metro to Sven's place which was very convenient. Overall, I would recommend Sven's place especially for its location and convenient transportation. "
1,"Losif Is very nice. The room and place description very accurate. Nice neighborhood, very quite, near the Metro and easy to get to the centre"
1,Julie is super nice and will go out of her way to inform you on things to do around Amsterdam. I would definitely come back!
1,"Henry and Iris are the best host you can find. Besides the perfect room, their hospitality and kindness are very special. They helped me a lot during my stay and I had a wonderful experience. 

The room and the bathroom were very clean, nice and big enough. There were even shampoos, extra towels and even little fridge was available. 

The location is very nice, easy to reach everywhere by the tram or bike. There are supermarkets and restauranta close by. It is a quiet and nice area."
1,Lovely place with everything you need. Perfect for our 12yr old who loved staying here. Marcel really makes everything comfortable and simple for your stay. Would highly recommend this beautiful apartment in a nice quiet area. 
1,"We'd like to thank Mirjam and Coen for the use of their apartment, their friendly, accommodating demeanour and for providing a clean and pleasant space for our three-night visit to Amsterdam. We didn't use the kitchen facilities but appreciated the nespresso machine greatly. This was my first experience of Amsterdam's famous near-vertical staircases and I'm glad I did before I get too decrepit!
The weather at the end of March was truly awful so we didn't get the opportunity to enjoy the local area of Watergraafsmeer as much as we would have liked, but took advantage of the good transport links to central Amsterdam to visit the Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum, Rembrandt's House etc.. We did manage to visit Elsa's bar a couple of times (convenient for the No.9 tram to the centre ) and the 'Teatina' Italian restaurant on Hogeweg, which was good but fairly expensive. "
1,"Louise was very kind and helpful. She made sure that we had everything that we needed. The breakfast that she prepared for us in the morning was great. The apartment was comfortable and had everything that we needed for our stay. It was a very short, convenient walk to the nearest metro station. "
1,"Very cosy apartment. My seven-month pregnant wife and I were extremely pleased with what we got. We could not have enough of just sitting at the window and enjoy the excellent canal view. The weather was awful, rainy, windy, but we did not mind it that much as staying indoors was actually great. 

The location is also hard to beat - everything is very close, yet it is a peaceful gracht and during the night it was very quiet, no drunkards, roaring motorbikes on the street.

Host is very nice, easygoing guy, welcomed us with fresh tulips and cold Heineken. "
1,"The host was great, as we were very late due to our flight being delayed. The hosts communication was attentive and very helpful during our entire stay. The location was great and close to everything.  The apartment was very clean and we felt right at home.  I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Amsterdam, our entire group loved the space snd the host."
1,"Great place, amazing location! So close to sooo many bars and restaurants. 

Much bigger than I thought it was going to be. 

Had a fantastic time. "
1,"Eli is a very kind, nice and beautiful host. She gave us many info about the neighbourhood, transport, bike rental ecc...everything you will need!
The apartment is clen, warm and shiny. The north zone of Amsterdam is ideal to live the city like a local!
If you are planning a trip to Amsterdam, this is a comfortable place to (website hidden). She is very nice and has a huge library in the living room!"
1,"Debby’s place is full of charm and character. It really feels like a ‘home away from home’. It has everything you need and is in a great location for going into central Amsterdam. The tram is near by and very convenient. Debby really helped us. I arrived with awful tooth pain and Debby found me an emergency dentist and gave me directions to get there. It was an unpleasant experience but was made much more bearable with Debby’s help. Her tips for local bars and restaurants are also good, we liked every one! I would not hesitate to recommend Debby’s place to any travelling to Amsterdam."
-1,"First of all, go find any other airbnb in Amsterdamm, this was a nightmare. We had an awful experience at Pieter's apartment. For simplicity, I will just paste my message regarding the condition of the apartment, as well as Pieters response. My message:""Hey Pieter, we were pretty disappointed at the cleanliness and accuracy of the description of your apartment. As for the cleanliness, the shower curtain was moldy, as was the shower walls and hose for the head. The sink and toilet were also pretty dirty. We cleaned most of those things ourselves upon arriving. The apartment didn't appear to have been vacuumed or dusted at all either which we also did. The stove top, counter, and walls of the kitchen didn't appear to have been cleaned recently, same with butter's eating space. When we went to use the washer all of our close smelled like mildew, I ran it empty on hot a few time and that did the trick. We didn't find your bed very comfortable so we went to sleep on the pullout couch and found it was broken which was disappointing. We managed to get it to work by blocking it in place with some furniture. Your refrigerator appears to be broken because it was warm inside and it contained a lot of spoiled food which smelled really bad. We we're also disappointed that the microwave was on top of your cubbards, so we had to stand on the counter to get it, pull it down, and plug it in before using it. We have both used Airbnb a lot in the past, and this is the most expensive, and most disappointing appartment we've stayed in. Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam, as well as the time we spent with butters, he is a very nice cat."" Pieter's response: ""Hi Nick, I'm disappointed in not only that you found the apartment dirty and not like in the pictures, but also in this request. The only claim I can attain to is the shower curtain one, as it indeed shows some colour, but that's not mold, it's just what a white shower curtain does. I believe you ruined the curtain by washing it, because now it doesn't work properly anymore. The dust on the cupboard should've been removed, I apologize for this. I cannot attain to the following things: - the microwave is stored above the cupboard because it's not a big apartment and that's basically one of the few places it can be stored. It's not so hard to get a chair and pick it up, right? - the cat's food place. Cats don't eat with fork and knife, yes, he spills next to the cups. That's not so weird. - the bed... what can I say? The mattress is 2 years old, that's brand new in bed terms. - the fridge was clean. I cleaned it myself. When I read these claims and see the photos, I'm very disappointed in you as a..."
1,"Imani is really smily and friendly ! Her place is really closed from the city center. You just have to take bus number 33 and you can go directly to the central station in 20 minutes! Her flat is quiet and you have your own entrance! I really recommend you that place which is really not expensive according to the city center! 
"
1,"Great place to stay. Walking distance from everything, although we did walk a lot. Unfortunately the hot water didn't work for the first two nights and we were only staying for 3 nights so it was a bit annoying. You don't want to deal with that when you're on holiday. I called Mike and he was responsive but a bit blasé about it all, glad we called airbnb and that got a quick response. My boyfriend had a cold showey which was awful, once the water was fixed it was amazing. Looks exactly like it does in the picture, all the mod cons. Perfect for a quick weekend away to explore Amsterdam city. Thanks again."
1,"Great private room and Shamira is very nice! We had a good moment at staying in this cool flat, not that far from the centre as it could look at a first glance (15min in bus from Central station). Shamira was a good help about renting bikes, nice seeing places to go, locations for night parties, etc. Nice private room, nice beds, quiet surroundings. "
-1,I didn't manage to live in Dr Hrishiraj's house so ignore the info about the house. I need to say I had a very disappointed experience. When I asked him about the house we made an agreement the house can for 2 person but he asked to transfer money as deposit and my scanned passport which is against the Airbnb's rule since we booked the room for King's day  when house was difficult to find I can only see yes. After booking he sent me all the info by email instead of app and I missed the part of check in time. He changed it to 10-12am and asked me to contact before I arrive. It was my fault but obviously it was not we talked before booking(he said he would be available all day).During the day he called me and I said I can't arrive during 10-12am ccause my plane arrived 11:30am he said he can check his time and called me back later in the afternoon. I didn't get the phone so I called back around 3pm it wasn't work and I missed his phone later. Then I totally lost his contact I called him almost 10 times and also texted and nothing reply. It was a cold and rainy night my friend and I stayed in MC super tired and angry. And I didn't get any explantion later. It was the most awful experience in Airbnb. As a reminder remember to check all the info with him and avoid the same story mine.
1,"Perfect week end ! 
It was very easy to go to the appartment from France, we can park the car in front of the appartment, and go to Amsterdam center by bus (it lasts less than 20minutes).
Judit was very nice and disponible.
Moreover the appartment is very pleasant and clean, for a reasonably price.
We recommand it !"
1,"Really modern and classy apartment in the Oud West of Amsterdam. Rogier is a really kind host, even if we stayed only one night. Don’t hesitate to rent the room in his apartment, everything’s clean, and all the photos are similar to reality 
5⭐️/5"
0,"Pros:
- Well located
- On time to check in, easy check out 
- 2 very large beds

Cons:
- apartment was absloutely disgusting when we arrived, there was probably a party the night before, bathroom full of shit an puke. A guy was cleaning when we arrived and stayed in the apartment additional hours to clean (we arrived at 2 pm). Awful vomit smell on the couch during the whole weekend.
- Not as spacious as it looks on the pictures
- the stairs are extremely steep
- the place does not look as new as on the photos"
1,"Everything was superb, i can truely recommend this accomodation!!
The bathroom in the Souterrain is freakin awesome! Thx"
1,"Living with the host is not a bad experience. The house is clean, and basically as big as described. Just that the house is not really close to the city center, at least 30 mins by bike if you are not familiar with the directions. The other things are fine. "
1,One of our most enjoyable AirBnB experiences! Loved the location which is wonderfully quiet at night yet not far from restaurants and shopping. Great communication and local information from Friso. Highly recommend.
1,"We stayed 2 weeks at Emil's house. He has been a very caring host. He came to pick us at the station and was always here to help (and he also has the sweetest little dog!). The room is clean and comfy. The house is easily reachable from Kraaienest metro which will take you downtine in 20 minutes. 
Definitely a high value-for-money room in Amsterdam.
"
1,"What can i say? The house it's really amazing, really well located and huge! Really calm and quiet and close to the city center. We will come back for sure if we will go again to Amsterdam. Highly recommended. THANK YOU A LOT!!!"
1,"Our best airbnb experience till now! Raquel is very helpful, with immediate correspondence and we feel really welcomed. The home is perfect: clean, fully equipped (awful kitchen and bathroom) yet cosy. Quiet and well connected neighborhood: a very nice area where you can have stroll in the park, biking experience, good places to eat and easy connection to enjoy all the city. "
1,"I spend the week end in amsterdam with a friend during a 4 days trip.
Even if I couldn't meet Sepp, he did everything he could to make me feel like at home. We talked by phone severall times and he was so kind
The appartement is very well placed, in a quiet area near to the city center. As he said in the description, the guy is renting his house. That's the air bnb spirit. Those who want to stay in a 5 star hotels should look for another appartement.
Those who just want to travel during a week end they will find a perfect place to stay.
Thank's Sepp!"
-1,"BUYER BEWARE! There are a lot of hosts who put a great deal of effort into ensuring their guests have a nice visit. This host is not one of them. We landed in Schipol, he disappeared. The carelessness and total disregard with which we were treated made this a terrible stay.  

The check in was the worst of any host we have ever experienced. Tired, jet-lagged and not all that familiar with Amsterdam, we had to travel from Schipol to Centraal -quite a bit of a distance both the airport & the apartment. 

Then we had to walk to an office that was about 10-15m away. After that, we had to walk with suitcases, to find a cab (Uber rides kept getting cancelled and we had multiple bags so public transportation wasn’t ideal) all of this cost us an additional 90-120 minutes on our first day,  in addition to the cost travel.

Upon arrival the apartment was it was clean/empty. The listing advertised a loaded kitchen yet there was nothing we could use to cook for ourselves. A cutting board but no knives. No cooking utensils (no wooden spoons, spatula, fork, ladle- nothing to handle hot food at all), no oven mitts to take food out of the oven,  no salt/pepper, no kitchen towels, no dish soap, no utensils to eat with except for plastic ones (perfect for a hot meal!), not even a microwave.

We were given two towels total to dry our hands, bodies, dishes, and wipe down the kitchen. We had to buy all the basics such as paper towels, cooking utensils and everything listed above. 

The host was very responsive to my first message (before we arrived) asking if there was a gym nearby. The day before we arrived, he send me a message about the confusing check in process, when we arrived there was a young woman who gave us the keys and told us there would be a binder with all the info we needed. That binder wasn't there when we got into the apartment, when I emailed asking for help connecting to the wifi,  I only got an automated reply saying he hoped I was happy. 

I messaged the next day explaining I was paying for international fees having to use data (rather than the wifi) no reply. I said that I needed to do work and needed wifi- no reply. I sent about 4 messages NOT ONE ACTUAL REPLY. 

Awful experience, we are only grateful our stay here was short."
1,"Our stay at Sander and Marijke's ""library"" was flawless. We could not have wished for a warmer and friendlier welcoming; on arrival receiving a fabulous 'run down' of important places to visit, restaurants to eat and certain tours to choose. They were lovely and approachable at all times during our stay.  

""The library"" was cosy and roomy with everything you needed and an outdoor sitting area to relax after a big day. The location was spectacular, a 2 minute walk from Rembrandt square, 30 second walk to a tram stop to the main train station, and beautifully quiet yet so close to the centre of town. 

Could not recommend this place high enough. 10/10
"
1,"The space was exactly as depicted in the pictures and me and my family loved it! The host (Mike) met us in the apartment and showed us everything we needed to know. He was very friendly and pointed us in the direction of some restaurants to try as we had arrived somewhat late on a Friday night so most places were full. The apartment was very comfortable and quite spacious for four people. The couch was comfortable to sit and chat on, and the beds were very comfortable as well. The whole place looks like it has been recently renovated and is quite modern. The main bathroom is very big with a separate shower and bathtub and there is a second toilet upstairs but it is in the same space as the beds, separated by a half-wall, so it is a bit strange. The location was also fantastic as it was extremely close to Centraal station and the downtown area, but also very close to the Jordaan area as well.

There were only a couple of hiccups that we didn't like too much. This apartment is listed on multiple rental websites, and on one of those websites (I can't remember which one) you can see a picture of a balcony. The balcony was off-limits and we had a smoker in the group so it was very inconvenient for her. I thought we should have been allowed out on the balcony if we didn't make any noise out there but the policy is very strict on not accessing the balcony, which we found disappointing although Mike was nice enough about it.

The other thing is that the walls / floors are very thin. You could hear the other people in the hallways when they were coming and going which wasn't a big deal, but there wasn't very good sound insulation between the two bedrooms. The loft bedroom is right over top of the master bedroom, and I could hear every rustle of the blanket and every word spoken down there. This was fine as it was me and my family traveling, but this may be more of an issue if, for example, two couples are traveling together and they want more privacy.

For the most part though the apartment was great and we were very happy there for the two nights we stayed."
1,"My husband and I highly recommend this flat/apartment for a convenient and quiet respite from a busy day touring Amsterdam. Conveniently located, it is two short streets walking distance to a tram stop to get to downtown. The street where this flat is located boasts several choices for bakeries, cafes and good quality grocery stores (the smaller Markt and larger Albert Heijn across the main street). Two beautiful parks are a 15 minute walk from the flat. The neighborhood itself is quite pleasant and much calmer than downtown Amsterdam. 

The apartment is cozy, clean and especially quiet after 10pm (22.00 hr) for sleeping (what a relief) on the very comfortable mattress. The bathroom is much larger than appear in the photos. Although I was looking forward to a relaxing soak in the deep and long bathtub, the days we visited Amsterdam were much too hot. So, I just enjoyed the separate walk-in shower. 

At the end of a day wandering the city, we felt right at home. With a complete kitchen, we were able to prepare a meal and relax. We actually made chicken soup with carrots and kale, which made for a hearty breakfast each morning. 

The rooftop patio, accessible to the adventurous via a steep stairway to the sky light, provides a cool place to relax on a warm evening with 360 degree views of the city. Opening and closing the skylight hatch does require some strength and height, so we do not recommend a person shorter than 5' 9"" (175cm) try this. My husband is 6' (182 cm) and he found it very challenging. Perhaps Florian knows a trick to accomplish this task more easily, but we did not ask. 

There was a clothes washer in a small closet, but we did not use it. Instead we washed a few items in the large bathroom sink, squeezed  excess water in a towel, and hung to dry. 

I would say that the only real challenge was climbing the 4 tall flights of narrow stairs to the flat (maybe 18 steps each flight). Because we packed lightly with a small daypack and carry-on bag each person, it was manageable ... and good exercise!. The handrail on the stairs was helpful. 

Again, I was very impressed at how quiet the flat/apartment was at night. So quiet, with the bedroom window open!!!

We never met Florian personally, but were able to keep in communication via the Airbnb application on our phones, when we had wifi. Florian was always very kind, cheerful, and helpful. We were greeted by his friend Norah who introduced us to the flat, then left us to enjoy it. 

Thank you Florian for letting us rent your home. Maybe we will meet another time. =D

To you dear traveler, if you can manage the stairs and short walk to the tram stop, put this apartment on your favorites list now!!! 
"
-1,"We are VERY upset with our stay here.

It is mentioned that the apartment is up '4 flights of stairs' - this is an understatement.  The stairs are literally vertical and in the UK  these would be considered a health and safety risk.  Climbing the stairs and taking our luggage up was a total joke.

Mira did not meet us, a friend of hers did.  Contrary to what Mira might say - there were 4 of us staying in the apartment.  Not 5 - even though on her description, Mira says it's fine for 5 people to stay.  So not sure what her problem is regardless.

Mira claims that we broke her sofa - not true, we sat on it for about an hour as we hated being in the apartment so much.  We apparently used this as an additional bed which is a total lie as we didn't even know it was a sofa bed until Sunday when we sat on it and it was rickety.  I would never sleep on it - it was stained and dirty.

The apartment photography is completely misleading, this apartment has incredibly low ceilings and is very small.  It's like being in a dolls house.

The apartment is located above a pizza shop and is VERY NOISY.

This was the most horrific experience and Mira is awful to deal with.


"
-1,"The woman who greeted us (who is not the host) took 50€ deposit cash for the key. When we wanted to check out and get the deposit back, she was not available and delayed us for 4 hours. She claimed to be on her way stuck in traffic, but we actually bumped into her in the lobby. At that point she said that she only works there and that she has no way of returning the deposit unless we wait more time. We requested to talk to the host and she claimed to have no way of contacting him. At that point we started to believe we were being scammed and we were feeling very insecure. The whole situation took place in our room, after the official checkout time. The woman and her partner (both not the host) let their terrifying dog wander around and enter our room, there were many people coming in and out. It was a very threatning and unpleasant situation, especially in such a controversial area. I will definately not return, and hope that no one else has to go through a similar experience."
1,"Wonderful. Shamira is a very great Person. the apartment is furnished very nice. We had plenty of room. furthermore it is within 10-15 minutes by car in the city. all in all a very nice stay. besides, we have only two days booked before new year. also very flexible"
1,Amazing ship - far exceeding expectations!! An experience
1,"Astrid was very welcoming! The room was comfortable and her whole house was attractive. She gave us great tips about local places to eat, to buy groceries, and which attractions were worth seeing. "
1,"Well I’ve got not much to say, this place is awesome. The location is great and the host is nice."
1,"Fantastic apartment.  We had such a bad experience in London, and how heart warming it was to be welcomed with such friendliness.

This apartment is immaculate.  It has everything you need and a great host.  He even left us wine to drink that came from our country. There was also goodies for us to eat in the fridge.  This host most definately goes the extra mile. This welcome stay made us decide to go back to Amsterdam.  This appartment is highly recommendable.

"
1,"Very nice accomodation. Communication was very good. 
would definately recommend."
-1,"This space was close to the museums we wanted to see and also close to the centre of the city. It was a great neighbourhood and a clean room. The bed was comfortable even if the room was small (although we knew from the pictures and other reviews that it would be, and it was no bother). We didn't get to meet Martijn, but his girlfriend let us in. She was nice and let us know some cool things to do around Amsterdam. 

There were a couple of issues that I am surprised I didn't read about in other reviews. Namely the bathroom. It was also small, but that is Amsterdam and we understood. The issues we had were the bath mat that was ALWAYS wet on the floor, and you could not use the toilet without standing on it. It was really icky. There was also a lot of mold in the shower. The main issue however was the fact the bathroom walls were covered in bugs! These tiny little bugs covered the plastered parts of the walls and it was so so awful. I understand this is an old house but renting out a space with walls covered in bugs is NOT OK. It was unsanitary and gave me the creeps. After I finished showering I still felt dirty because I could see all the little bugs scurrying around the walls. This problem must be fixed. If we had known about this issue we would not have stayed there, or paid the amount we did. 

Unrelated to that, there was construction happening on the building right outside our window that would start at 7am every morning. I wish they had given us a heads up so we could have brought earplugs or something. It was so loud and very frustrating. "
1,"Andrea was an awesome host! The place was VERY clean. It has every you need. Great location, right next to the metro. There are beautiful bike paths around her neighborhood. We had an awesome time! She gave us exellent directions from the airport to her place, as well as, information to get around  the city! We would recommend staying here!"
1,"The location of this house is excellent. The street is quiet and many of the best restaurants are nearby. You can easily walk to most attractions in 10-15 minutes but the best way to get around by far is to rent bikes. The city is built for cyclists and bikes are everywhere. The apartment gives you a sense of how people have lived in Amsterdam for centuries. There is a rooftop seating area that can be a lot of fun to hang out in. We did enjoy the modern kitchen and easily cooked a few meals there. We were really happy with our stay here and recommend it highly to others. Thank you, Michelle!"
1,As expected. Everything was good and we had no problems at all. Everyone was nice to us.
-1,"Basically she illegally parks her camper on a hotel parking lot and then tells guests to use the hotel facilities - going into the hotel we discovered the hotel have known about her for awhile and are completely NOT COOL with her idea of the arrangement. They told us they have considered calling the police on her several times.

While La Bella was showing us how to lock the door which does not lock properly and explaining how to use the toilet but adding ""dont use it though it doesn't really work, your poop will go everywhere and I will have to clean it"",  a homeless man wandered past us drunk and closely vommited his guts out on the side of a nearby tree.

Funnily enough the host La Bella actually says the hotel are friendly and using the facilities is no problem as long as you are friendly to them. The hotel and netherlandish freedom camping laws have different ideas.

It was disgusting and embarrassing we did not sleep once in the parking lot camper.

This is completely inappropriate and disgusting that I paid over 120 euros to live as temporary criminals in a parking lot who cant even go to the toilet. I thought AirBnb was better than this and I hope she does not continue her scam for the sake of others."
1,"Our stay for nearly one month at Avishai and Katja Lisa's home was very pleasant, and we could rest a lot. Such a nice place, sorrounded by water and care of the hosts. We thank the couple for the trust the had in us during our long stay. They are really easy-going, friendly people, including their multilingual little son. How cute he is! We are looking foward to coming back next year...

"
1,"Rogier is a very nice and helpful guy. The communication was easy, everything was as I had expected. I totally enjoyed my stay at Rogier‘s appartment and can recommend this lovely place."
0,"As any review should this one will have two parts: good and not so good... and I will try to be as much objective as I could.

Good: 
Apartment is located at really nice and quiet residential area, not too far from the center of the city - approximately 15 minutes by tram and around 30-40 min to walk. We had never met Mart, but all communications were smooth and easy. He provided us with all needed information and also was so kind to permite us a late checkout.

Not so good:
1. Two towels provided were really small to use in shower and both smell awfully. 
2. Apartment has two big balcony windows, one against another. One of them does not have curtains, so you do not feel comfortable to get out of the shower. 
3. As other travelers already complained - light in the bathroom is very dim. 
4. Apartment was little dusty... "
-1,"Fazit: NOT recommended.

Location:  A relatively new place with easy public transportation. However, we could consider the nearby communities to be in Africa before we realized it was in Netherlands.

Hardware: barely called well furnitured. Everything prepared was like temporary. Frankly speaking, we felt it could be compared with refugee accommodation in west Europe.

Sanitary condition: As said, the apartment is not finished with sanitary, which was also not clean enough. 

Communication: good.

Good thing is we just stayed for a night, so that we didn't need to worry too much about the SAFETY. The first bad experience since with Airbnb.

To the host: sorry that I have to mention the facts that my grandmother insists. Please keep improving before posting for potential guests. 致礼."
1,"Judit's flat was very cozy and comfortable for two people. It's clean and looks very nice. The apartment and the neighbors were all great as well. The apartment may seem a bit far from the centrum, but the bus nearby runs at all times and takes you to the center in 20-30 minutes, and you will get some very nice-looking views along the way. Judit herself was a pleasure to deal with, and very accommodating when we were in a pinch, for which I thank her."
1,"This was a great place, perfect size for two. Near the bus and grocery store we had a wonderful time. "
1,"Andrea was very kind and she made us feel welcome. The room has enough living space for two, due to the smart furnishing. There's a small table you can use either as a work place or dinner table. Also, Andrea made sure to provide us with information on restaurants and places that are close by, which was really nice. We rented her room for 2 nights only, but I would also recommend this if you plan on booking a longer stay."
-1,Its a scam!
1,Great location and a really stylish flat. Room are in the basement which was great as it meant they were lovely and cool in the hot weather!
1,"The apartment is very clean, stylish, and spacious. Marian was very welcoming. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the nearest tram stop. From there it's only 15 minutes to the centre. There are also a few supermarkets nearby. The apartment is nice and quiet at night."
1,"Really good experience. Judit is a great host. The apartment is very good in a calm and lovely area. Easy to get to the center station. 
Only thing not that good is the bed, bit noisy and unconfortable, but not a real problem.
Would definitely consider staying there again."
-1,Do not even think about planning to stay here.  This is a big scam -- totally misrepresented in airbnb listing and shouldn't be part of airbnb at all.
-1,Awful room. Dusty and unkept with a very unpleasant smell. The sheets were not changed for our arrival; in fact the washing machine had wet washing in it with clothes also in the dryer. We had to change our own sheets and deal with a blocked sink and no remote for the tv. Wouldn’t recommend at all.
1,"Space was great. Everything you need is in the apartment. Great location. Had a superb time. Getting to the unit is definitely something to be noted due to the steep and slim staircase. But once your there it's a great 
Only negative was the down stairs bathroom. It had a awful smell coming from the toilet and shower. My wife and I tried to turned on shower to run the water first like instructed. No more than a few mins later the smell was back. Also the sink in bathroom had a leak. We spent most of our stay on the upper level. Which was very nice and relaxing with the fireplace and nice view "
1,"Judit is very good at communicating. Very quick. She wasn't able to meet personally but good arrangement was made for the check in and check out.

The apartment is lovely. Compact and clean. There is a step on the entry to the bathroom, careful if you walk in half asleep! 
The bus connection is frequent and the night bus also runs to the same stop.

We had a good time even though the weather in Amsterdam was not so great. Would definitely recommend."
1,"We had an absolutely amazing time at Stephan's place. He was such a welcoming host, giving us tips on things to do and making us feel completely at home as soon as we arrived.

The apartment is stunning - the view across the canal is pure Amsterdam, while being away from the hustle and bustle of the centre. It was so easy to get around (luckily for us, as my sense of direction is awful) - just 3 tram stops from the centre, and Zeeburg has all you could need too. 

We loved it so much we found it hard to leave the flat every morning - one of our favourite memories of our trip will be sitting on that sofa, watching the geese waddle past the window. 

We totally recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Amsterdam... book it! Now!"
1,"Nicky’s place is in a perfect location, and has everything you need. Our only issues were with check-in, as Nicky never told us the code to get in, and I therefore had to turn my phone off of airplane mode, and use international data for the week just to get a hold of her. She did not communicate which keys we needed, or where we could find WiFi beforehand. Once we got through all of that, everything was great."
0,"For the amount of money spent for 4 separate beds in the center of Amsterdam, this was a pretty good deal. The communal space was large and comfy + location was prime. However, there was an AWFUL smell throughout the apartment (especially on the first floor) of bad sewage. I tried to reach out to Christiaan over the airbnb app but got no response."
1,"Carolina was a wonderful host :) she made us feel comfortable and welcome, and was very accommodating! Her place is in a good location, with everything you need nearby and it is only 15-20 minutes to the city center by bus. It was perfect for us, and we would definitely recommend her! "
1,"We couldn’t have imagined better hosts than Mike and his wife! 
They were so nice, welcoming and thoughtful towards us. When we arrived, we found a beautiful and cozy room waiting for us, with everything we needed to make us at ease. They encouraged us to use all the facilities in the house whenever we needed them (kitchen, tv, washing machine…). Every morning, Mike and his wife were preparing a delicious breakfast that we were eating altogether, we enjoyed it so much! They also were always available to give us advice about what to do in Amsterdam and how to get the most easily to each place! 
Concerning the location, it is perfectly located on several tram and bus lines going directly to Amsterdam center (Dam Square, Centraal Station) in less than half an hour!
The surroundings of the apartment are really convenient (Jumbo supermarket, restaurants, shopping center, etc.).
We could not recommend more Mike and his wife! We were so happy to meet them, and were really sad when we had to say goodbye!
Thank you for all to both of you, we hope to see you soon in Paris !

1,Great
0,"The apartment was in a good neighborhood and very close to the tram stop. Everything is exactly like in the pictures - small but cozy and convenient for 4 people. Also, you don't need to bring any towels at all. We were only sorry to find that Ellen was not very eager to help or at least offer some helpful alternatives in certain situations; that's what we felt. For example, we had to buy the toilet paper (it's the first time we faced this situation on Airbnb) and the host did not provide an extra blanket when we needed and asked for one. Our the greatest disappointment was that we were not allowed to leave the luggage at the apartment for a few hours after checking out (this is also a first on Airbnb for me). All in all, it was not a bad experience but if these kinda situations are important for you while travelling, you might want to take these into consideration."
1,"Great location, comfortable apartment, would recommend. "
1,"Our stay with Martijn (and Koos) was fantastic. Both are great guys ad Martijn was helpful right from the off - his replies to my endless questions were always quick, helpful and always friendly. He was also extremely accommodating with any changes or extras I requested. 

The boat is in a fantastic area only about 20 mins out of central Amsterdam (reachable by bus then tram or taxi) and a lot of fun to stay on...spacious inside (the cabins less so) and loads of room up on deck with plenty of room to sit and relax. 

There were 10 of us and we booked the sailing and breakfast on one day of our three day stay and I can recommend both. The sailing was fantastic, lasting about 4/5 hours and after a heavy night before the cooked breakfast upon waking up was very welcome! 

We were even allowed to stay on the boat past check-out as we enjoyed our time so much. All in all - a top spot if you're staying in Amsterdam and want a little respite from the hectic town centre. "
0,"Overall not bad experience- but some points- we paid full amount but there wasnt any contact details, because they also asked 40€ for late check in (22.30), after I paid it they have sent lady who also was first time in this apartment, we asked for blanket and sleppers but no responce was given, there wasn’t light at second bedroom, not comfortable shower and bathroom, the response from host is also bad, only location is for 5 star."
-1,"I am staying more than 200 nights per year out of my home, which makes me maybe a bit more critical than some other people. And, sindce Ivan and his wife rent out their places as professionals I/we expect the same standards as I would expect from any hotel, especially since the prices or this flat are also quiet high.

Ivan and his wife were friendly upon our arrival, therefore nothing to complain.  And, that the steirs are extremly steep to reach the flat isnot their failure, but typically for Amsterdam.  Also the surroundings of the flat and the location fitted our need very well.

On the first view the masterbedroom is very nice and big, and also the second bedroom on top is fine. But, fore sure this is not a flat for 6 adults, because the quality and the space in the connecting room is inaccepptable. The whole interior provides is lower IKEA standard, just installed to people, who stay only a few days. The whole craftsmanship of the items/cabinets installed is of poor quality and should be enhanced a lot

All this points would not have led us down, if the flat would have been clean and neat. But, we found so many unpleasent details, which in a hotel would have let me leave the building immedeately.

We found dirty cutlery, broken cabinets, a bedcover with huge dirt stains, a freezer part totally frozen,  dust, broken hangers, a unsuitable showerhead et. al..., which for me/us is just not acceptable and understandable at all!

It is a different story if somebody lives in an flat, and just rents out a room, as the original idea of airbnb was. But, if you earn you living from it, than you should also lift up your standards as you can expect in a professional business. 

I have rented similar places from professional providers in other cities, and until know we had allways very pleasant experiences. And, I trust Ivan and his wife can also provid the same, if they are really up to it.

Sorry, but personally, after our experiences, I would not recommend this place to our friends, even we enjoyed our time in Amsterdam very much."
1,"Nice and quiet houseboat apartment in the beautiful north side of Amsterdam. Living and dining space is a bit small, but ok for two guests. Bedroom area is more spacious but the ceiling is too low, approximately 175cm, which will make things a bit uncomfortable for guests that are taller than that. The small floating terrace is very nice. We sat there numerous times. There are people living on the same houseboat behind the adjacent walls of the apartment. Short walks will take you to nearby bus stations, and nearby parks and tranquil areas that one can just sit back and relax. The host was easily reachable and responded quickly to any inquiries."
-1,It was an awful experience. The place is not finished. Walls in kitchen seem to need repair. Bed only handles light weight. Husband landed on floor 2 nights. No drapes in bedroom. Dirty walls and bedroom door looks like someone tried to break in. Loud with gym of some sort downstairs. 
1,"Andrea is a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful. She advises us where to go, where to eat, what to do etc. The room was fantastic. It is clean, perfectly furnished, and comfortable.
Location is near to the metro, supermarket .... 
Amsterdam is a wonderful city, and much of the experience is about the people. Having hosts like Andrea really make it special.
We surely hope to be back.
Would definitely recommend to everybody!
"
-1,"The location is pretty good and located in a lovely area of Amsterdam, the apartment is much smaller than expected and there are not two double beds. It is one double bed and a small children’s single. The bathroom smelt pretty awful and there were ants all over the living room and kitchen from when we arrived. The bnb manager was very unresponsive and when we arrived to find the keys didn’t work to the apartment block (resulting in us ringing the bell and waking up irritable residents) they were no help at all, telling us to “try harder”. This kind of ruined our trip as we had to leave someone in the flat at all times in order for them to let us in late in the evening."
-1,"At 460 Euros/night with all taxes and fees included, we felt very disappointed by this appartment.
We found the appartment really dirty and very dusty. It also seemed as if the balcony was not cleaned for at least 6 months.
The dishes in the closet were not clean neither.
We also had to clean the baby chair that we found in the messy closet.
The bathroom smelled like urine when we arrived
The photos are not accurate.  The appartment is much smaller than it appears.  The bedrooms are not as nice as in the misleading pictures. 
Finally, on the last night, at 1 am, we received a phone call from someone who called on behalf of the appartment owner. He was telling us that the neighbors were complaining about the loud music.Not only there was no music played during our entire stay in this appartment,  but this phone call woke up my 11 months old daughter and my 6 years old daughter.
The man, who called us twice and left us an unfair text message had to apologise  for his mistake when he found out that he has called the wrong appartment. We were unfairly woken up for nothing.
Such mistakes should not be tolerated
We will not stay in this appartment again!"
1,"Thanks Rene for the perfect stay in Amsterdam. The location of the flat was perfect - close proximity to most things in Amsterdam by foot or by bike.

We particularly enjoyed that it was a top floor flat, with a roof terrace to enjoy the summer sunshine. "
1,"The house is very nice and comfortable, we were 5 and there was plenty of room for us, the house had all the amenities we needed including a fully equipped kitchen. Chris welcomed us and was very nice and helpful. The location is great, very close to Amsterdam center, easy access to freeways.
Overall we very enjoyed our stay."
1,"Anne is a very friendly, clean amd educate person. Was my first experience at AirBnB and was afraid to get scammed or lost but the communication was really good. Very good tips and very good welcoming. Even it was not difficult at all, I tried to be nice and very respectuous too because in the end - even that unfortunately not always - sometimes you get what you give. And Anne will show you that respect too.  Anne is that person that will make you feel like at home. Thanks!!"
-1,"Warning all future airbnbers: this apartment looks nothing like the photos. We ended up leaving after the first night because the experience was so awful. We are 3 travelling adults expecting two bedrooms with proper beds, and ended up getting a room crammed with 3 blow up mattresses on the floor. The bathroom was filthy and the host was unhelpful when asking for a refund. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. "
0,our stay was good..check with owners first regarding who's going to host you as we had a bad experience with the host..
1,"First, about the boat itself.
The boat was an interesting experience for us. We loved having our breakfast while swayed softly by the waves. The room was a little crampy so we had a little hard time to open our two suitcases. The toilet was a little different from normal toilet ( I overflowed it once because I don't know how to use it ), but it is easy to use once you know how to operate it.
However, the sleep in here is one of the best sleep I had. The sound and the movement of waves, the quiet surroundong made me sleep really good.
The location of the boat is really close, about 10 minutes walk. It is really strategic if you are thinking on using train to go to other cities and also strategic if you are thinking of using tram to sightseeing around the city.
Lastly, Ton himself was really helpful and communicative. One of the best host I've ever met.
"
1,"I'm sure Dirk would love it if I said this was the weirdest place I've ever found on airbnb... unfortunately it's not... but it came awful close! The eclectic collection of odd objects aside, the place is very spacious and comfortable - I was able to host two guests easily - and gave me the chance to discover a little corner of Amsterdam I wasn't familiar with. Check-in and check-out were flawless and Dirk checked in during the stay to make sure that I had everything I needed. All in all, great! Don't miss the chance to stay here!"
1,Great place to stay own room easy to get to town
1,"We really enjoyed our stay at this apartment! It was clean, nicely done up and the location is great! Right in the center, near the central station and many sights. Towards the apartment there´s a supermarket which is really nice to have. The booking was easy and the contact really friendly. Thanks a lot!"
1,"The location was great, lots of shops, restaurants, quirky places and a huge market nearby. It was also easy to navigate how to get to the centre.  The apartment itself was cute and had everything we needed and I loved the balcony, but the stairs were really steep. Alon and Batja were easy to get a hold of and they were both very friendly and helpful throughout our stay."
0,"Good place, but real apt not like on photos. Apt is smaller and not so bright. "
1,"Amsterdam in itself is spectacular , so nothing will make it a bad experience. As for the apartment, it's great , it is outside the center , but the city is super and everything is walkable in 30-40 minutes away. The home is shared with others tourists enjoying the city. The kitchen is large but lacked basics like dish detergent , and the second floor the kettle and the microwave were, but nothing to bother . That if the bathroom is very small and the shower room is huge ."
1,Excellent location and all around fabulous! We loved staying on this boat on the canal! Highly recommended! Everything was perfect!
0,"The apartment is in a great location, just a few blocks off of a very nice main road with cafes and shops. It is small and cosy with all of the basics you need for a short stay in amsterdam.  Overall, a comfortable place to stay.

Unfortunately though, the bicycles that come with the apartment are very old and not safe to ride. Our brakes were broken and mine had a flat tire. We couldn't ride them at all. We booked the flat specifically for this reason, so that was a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise, a great stay. "
1,"Our stay at Judit's was great! We had a little bit of trouble with the internet, and the trip into the city was a bit longer by bus than we'd imagined, but the place was very nice and Judit was great. Would recommend her place if you are trying to see the city by day and retreat to a quieter, cozy location at night. "
-1,"To be honest I'm not sure I could have spent more than one night at the place, since the common bathroom was awfully small, the shower i had was ice cold and I was literally a broken window away from flocks of pidgeons. The portuguese woman that handled the check in was very kind and waited for my late arrival, but all in all 120 euros/night for such an accomodation left me baffled. I understand Amsterdam is expensive, but I would have expected  little more care."
-1,"This place has not heating at all except for his living room, it is extremely cold. I had to leave the next day as it was impossible to stay in a room with such temperature. The host never proposed to fix the problem and after I told him I wanted to leave he also decided to keep the money for the whole stay.......
Truly bad experience and no effort to fix or arrange things. What a shame renting a room on these conditions!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The house is beautiful and Anna gave us    Good directions on how to get there. The room had everything we needed and is well connected to tram lines.
1,"The host welcomed us with a lovely note and a bottle of wine to make us feel at home. the neighbourhood had a quiet comunity feel, close to shops and the train station. Lovely big appartment, we very much enjoyed the garden in the sun! overall it was great! "
1,"The host , emile , was very nice . Because we were late home from the party we slept until later in the day. All this was not a problem and there was even taken into account the fact that we were still asleep .
It's not a far walk from the station and Ziggodome Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena ( 15 min) , so easily accessible.
The room was very nice and comfortable. It was a very nice and good bed. There were towels and shower stuff and everything was very neat and tidy.
Even the food and drink was all arranged. In short we were very pleased and it is definitely recommended."
1,Lovely apartment. We were four people and Marion's flat was just perfect for us. The location was great with a supermarket around the corner and only 10 min with the tram to reach the city center. Communication check-in and check-out we're fast and easy. Thanks for the pleasant stay!
1," Nice room, friendly people, cool cats, the tea is superb, music could be louder •"
1,"Iosif, Alina and Adrian were great hosts. They made us feel very welcome and were always ready to help in any way they could. It was a perfect environment for new-comers to the country. The accommodation was clean and comfortable, and only a short metro ride into the city centre. Worth it for the disco shower on its own ;)
Thanks guys! It was a great first start to our life together in Amsterdam :)"
-1,"Overall a very bad experience!
Host arrived 4 hrs late, half day lost.
Neighborhood was great!
I arrived to the place and I had to wait until the host did the apartment cleaning.
Leak on the toilet, gallons and gallons of wasted water during my stay, I adviced the host, he never reply back."
1,Great stay. Boat ride was the best part. 
-1,"This was a bad experience. 1. Problems started even before we arrived. Maxine asked us to pay her separately a Euro 40 cleaning fees on top of the official Airbnb price that was agreed upon and pre-paid at reservation time. We refused to pay this cleaning fee. 

On arrival, we found out that the address on file was different than the actual address. The house number on file was 8III, while we stayed in probably 10E. The pictures were of the house that we stayed in, but we're done up to reflect a far better accommodation that it was. 

On arrival at 8.45pm (check-in time was around 2pm I think) we were made to wait outside the apartment for 15 min so that the apartment could be finished cleaning. After that Maxine and 2 cleaners came out of the apartment and told us that the apartment is ready for us. 

Inside the apartment there was a wet panty lying on the shower knob. The linen was dirty, we weren't sure if the towels were washed. The house was smelling of smoke. There was an open can of coke lying on the table. Overall, we were highly disappointed. "
-1,"3 days before my arrival Philip told me that the apartment I booked was not available and suggested another.
When I arrived the situation was completely different from what expected and I could not stay with my family. Then I tried to contact Philip unsuccessfully (he was not there when we arrived) and therefore I had to call airbnb to manage the issue. In the meanwhile I went to an hotel.
Overall, a very bad experience. My suggestion: double check the condition of the apartments and do not accept a last minute change"
-1,"This apartment was the worst. The toilet was the wrong way round with the seat the right way round. As two beds, one was a blow up bed on the floor in the living room area. 
The balcony wasn't stable, the only good thing was the sofa, The TV didn't even work in English!. I booked another apartment the day after I checked into this place. I would not recommend staying here "
1,"Reza is a wonderful host!
Although there was a problem and the water stopped working one morning, Reza answered my SMS really quick and helped us understand the situation. It wasn't his fault so we waited couple of hours till the municipality restart the water works.
The apt is much bigger than seen on reza's photos - which was a delight. The bathroom on the other hand is simply awful, sorry to say it, but it is not look clean even if it does. His appartment is 10 minutes walking for every tram/metro needed.
2 coffe shops nearby, and really close to Albert cuyp market.
Overall, nice play to stay for so cheap, you can enjoy Amsterdam without a shower a day, :-) haha.
thanks for helping us reza!
Best wishes"
1,"My stay here was absolutely fantastic! Perfect location (close to tram with a 10 minute scenic walk or option to get closer bus) with transportation directly to city Center. Safe area that we enjoyed with restaurants/ice cream near by. Kevin went above and beyond for us, providing us with bus passes, some breakfast items and fruit, access to his bikes which we loved, and his mother even brought us freshly baked cookies on the last night of our stay. Would highly recommend to other guests! "
1,"Highly recommended!!
Staying at Andrea's place was better than any hotel I have been to. She was extremely helpful with suggestions on what to do and see and the room couldn't have been any cleaner or more cozy. She went above and beyond what I would expect a host to do. 
The place is extremely close to a metro station and even a night bus stop. Although it takes a bit to get into the city center (maybe 20 minutes) it is definitely worth the time in order to receive such hospitality. "
1,Great stay!
0,"This was an extremely comfortable apartment near to public transport links with a large supermarket behind it and restaurants, bars and corner shops nearby. Looks much better in person than in the photos. Zyad was very easy to communicate with and provided somewhere comfortable to stay. Don't know why everyone's complaining about the location as could easily walk to centrum in 40 minutes and 10 minutes by bus. However, we were meant to check-in at 3PM (which I presume means a clean and ready room as it would in a hotel) - whereas whilst we were able to drop our suitcases off the room wasn't ready until 7.30PM which left us outside after a flight when we really just needed to go and get ready properly. Felt a little bit scammed really. Nonetheless, lovely flat and would recommend - just do feel somewhat cheated."
1,Miranda was an excellent host. She was very friendly and welcoming. The food was delicious!
1,"Nick was an incredibly kind and flexible host. We weren't organized enough to arrange a meet time ahead of our travel date, and so he left work suddenly to meet us at the last minute… What a guy!
He left us a bottle of red wine, and made sure we had everything we needed at the apartment, including some Dutch treats! (Now an addiction - thank you Nick) ;-)
His apartment is really spacious and homely. There's a great big cheap supermarket right across the street, and a fruit & veg market most days as well! PLUS… it's only 10 mins by bus to get to central station. 
Nick really is the nicest guy you might ever meet.
"
0,Easy to book and good communication. Location was good. Kitchen and bathroom look good Flat was a good size for two people not really suitable for 4 as one is sofa bed which is not comfortable at all. Bedroom is good size and has waredrobe although the bed had a few stain marks on them and flat was very dusty! The stairs leading into the flat were awfully filthy too. No iron if you need it. Overall was ok
0,"The room was nice but we were a bit disappointed by the fact that the bathroom was in the entrance of the house and not directly connected to the bedroom. The house is easily accessible by tram from central station and the neighbourhood was very pretty. It is not the quietest place because of the small children playing on Sunday morning but it's ok if you get up early. What made our stay great was Eva and Chris who were really available and friendly. We asked for them to turn the heat on and they did it asap. However maybe it is a bit too expensive for what you get: the room would be really enhanced with just a home-made little guide to Amsterdam, and a kettle or coffee-maker (there is no breakfast so you have to go to the center to get it). Eva really is the nicest host though :)"
1,"Noortje's apartment is lovely, very spacious and welcoming. She is a gracious hostess, and is quick to respond to inquiries. Noortje provided very thorough and helpful information on the best way for us to get to the apartment, and check in was effortless. The apartment was incredibly well stocked, and even included games and dvds. The bathroom is amazing, and included a shower and a separate bathtub. The location of the apartment is perfect, with tram stops very nearby to take us wherever we were headed. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay here very much and would definitely love to return. Thank you, Noortje!"
1,"The apartment is beautiful and nicely furnished!! Joeri is awfully nice, cool and a good host! Thank you, you saved our journey! ;)"
1,Pretty nice
1,"It was a really nice stay at Judit's place. The studio has everything and it was very well comunicated, only 15 minutes by bus to get to the central station (each one every 5-10min). It's a great option if you're looking for something not far and, at the same time, calm and quiet. "
1,We just loved the experience!!!! Super cosy and ideal for a Amsterdam stay.
0,"This is one of these 'managed' airbnb which I feel rob the site of this genuine feeling, that said, they announce it upfront, so I didn't feel cheated. 

The best part was the 'instant booking' availability, which I wish more host were making use of, as it makes life so much easier. 

On the downside, it's an apartment that has seen an awful lot of use - with fixtures falling apart at the seams, and the toilet curtain literally falling down on my head (so did the shower head, rather ironically). 

I think you can't quite avoid these things as the cleaning team is probably not that involved.

TLDR: it's not charming, it's not as central as it says it is, and it could be better fixture wise. That said, it's still better value than a hotel. "
